  Text: Dusk Hi, this is my first Celeste level. As of right now, there are 9 required
    rooms and 3 optional rooms. There are 4 strawberries and there's a hidden Blue
    Heart too. Difficulty-wise, it's like main game's Farewell chapter, although this
    requires reverse hyperdashes and reverse wavedashes too. The strawberries are
    a lot more technical and require more tech knowledge/skill (neutral climbs, ultradashes
    and whatnot). Progress Gameplay-wise, I still need to tweak and polish some stuff
    here and there for sure, but aside from that it's mostly done. I still need to
    work on the estetics of the level though, and maybe I'll add some custom music
    if my irl friend wants to collab.

  Description: Rite of the Jungle in Celeste!
  Text: 'This is a WIP Campaign and currently only contains the first chapter, Rite
    of the Jungle. This map will be updated if and when I make the other 4 chapters.
    Since the map is intended to be completed dashless, no tech is required, but I
    left the dash in for those who want the option to go fast. This project started
    as a way for me to learn how to use Ahorn without the need to be original or creative,
    instead allowing me to focus only on learning the tools and how things work. I
    really enjoy RITE and when I noticed the levels in RITE were the same size as
    a screen in Celeste, I thought it would be a fun idea to try and re-create it
    as accurately as possible. If you like this map and enjoy precision platformers,

  Description: 1D but cycles. (That's about it)
  Text: 'Have you ever thought the d-sides pack was too easy? Well, I have a solution
    to that! This map contains: Cycles More Cycles A Golden Strawberry And even more
    cycles! For those of you who don''t know, Monica (the creator of the d-sides pack),
    also created a much harder version of 7d called 5b_garbage_version.bin. The map
    consisted of the exact same screens as 7d, but had MANY extra spinner cycles.
    I was inspired by this to make a version of 1D that follows the same concept.
    This map is brutal to put it bluntly. Every screen has an intended strat/cycle,
    but it is not much easier than any other path you could take. Good luck to everyone
    who attempts this! Lastly, two thing: 1. The process of making this map was not
    just me spamming cycles, and just changing them slightly to make it possible.
    I spent up to 2 hours on some screens to try and make it semi-enjoyable, and have
    some sort of rhythm to it. Granted, some screens are worse than others. 2. Sorry
    about the map not being packaged, I have been in a very tight time crunch to get
    this map out before school starts again, and I have been having some technical
    problems with my laptop itself.'

    Included Maps The Evil-sides Includes an introduction chapter and a gameplay chapter.
    This was planned to be a campaign of 3-5 chapters, each with about 20 gameplay
    screens. Feelings Includes an introduction chapter and a gameplay chapter. This
    was supposed to be one long dashless chapter about Madeline's feelings and her
    recovering from what had happened to her before visiting the World of Shine. Granny's
    Task Includes two short gameplay chapters. This was going to be a three chapter
    story about someone pretending to be Granny and sending Madeline to a strange
    tower to get her trapped there forever. Islands of Mystery One gameplay chapter.
    Was supposed to be a whole bunch of mini-maps in a lobby, much like a collab but
    made by just one person. Mystic Mountain One gameplay chapter. Was going to be
    a long summit map going up to 4000M and possibly even higher, a very ambitious
    and failed project. Summit Reimagined One gameplay chapter. My first attempt at
    a summit map, stopped pretty early on.

  Description: A Wacky Hacky Helper by Yours Truly
  Text: 'Welcome to Jackal Helper! If you''ve ever thought, "Hey, I need a really
    obscure entity!", this is the place to be! Featuring a whole two (wow, so many)
    new entities, Jackal Helper will be host to whatever I make and could be interesting
    to publish, or anything I randomly get requested. This helper won''t really have
    a theme, but will likely be updated whenever I post a new map (if I ever get around
    to finishing Cryoshock). Currently, Jackal Helper has two available entities:
    Core Booster: Green by day, red by night! This booster acts as a normal red booster
    when the core mode is set to hot, and a normal green booster when set to cold.
    However, upon entering and leaving a booster or chain of boosters including one
    or more Core Boosters, the core mode will switch alongside the behavior of the
    booster! Please note that this occurs when you leave a boosting state, so combining
    boosters into a chain will only change the core mode after the last booster. Stopwatch
    Refill: Low budget time travel? Maybe... Upon first glance, the Stopwatch Refill
    acts like a glorified refill. However, you''ll notice that a trail follows you
    upon touching the crystal, and when the trail fades away you''ll be zipped back
    to the refill''s location, preserving any momentum and dashes you collected along
    the way. Useful for funny recursive gameplay or momentum puzzles, this refill
    has endless possibilities! and definitely isn''t an excuse for me to make jank
    corner boosts If you have any questions, bugs, or suggestions, please reach out
    to me either via Celestecord, Dadbod Discord, or DM at Jackal#0880. Admittedly,
    I''m not the best at coding so any feedback you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

    or move it to the right side). Make the buttons shown configurable. I didn't want
    to use the players key bindings because the keys aren't all uniform width (e.g.
    space is wider). Handle two jump buttons. Handle demodash. Show if inputs have

  Description: Madeline climbs a smaller mountain that looks oddly similar to Celeste

  Text: Madeline climbs a smaller mountain that looks oddly similar to Celeste Mountain,
    just really small. This was my first ever Celeste map, made over about 3 months,
    and it comes with an A, B, & C-side. And also lots of secrets! The A-side is fairly
    easy. You can beat it and collect 16 of the 17 strawberries with regular A-side
    level tech. There is one hidden strawberry that needs advanced tech. There's also
    a special hard path and a secret challenge if you know how to demodash. This map
    is pretty jank since it was the first one I ever made, but I guess that gives
    it a bit of charm. The B-side ramps up the difficulty a lot. You'll need to know
    C-side and Farewell tech, and there are also some required neutrals. There are
    26 berries in this one. Also, the optional expert path in this one requires a
    demodash with a much harder setup, and the difficulty there is probably around
    D-side level. This side is my personal favorite and took the longest to make,
    but I'd like to see what you think! The C-side is a bit harder than the B-side,
    and it contains 8 red berries. The only thing you'll need are some spike jumps
    and jellyvators. There are actually two expert paths in this one. The first one
    is near the beginning of the level and uses a bit more precise gameplay, but isn't
    terrible (a lot easier than the B-side expert path). The second one though requires
    the hardest demodash yet if you want to enter, and once you do the tech is the
    most insane yet. To get an idea, I had to teach myself chained ultras to create
    that path, and I'm still bad at it. If you complete it, you'll get a Moon Berry
    for your suffering. If there's any game-breaking jank or weirdness, just let me
    know and I can try to patch it up.

  Text: '-The Kayonara Collection- The Kayonara Collection is a collection of 3 maps
    I had made around a year ago now, with various changes, bug fixes, and new features.
    There is also a new bonus level, which is pretty difficult, and some may find
    enjoyable. Info: The A Side has 25 red berries. The final berry requires you to
    collect all the other berries in a single run, like a full clear. The B, C, and
    Heart Side only has a Deathless and Silver berry. I want to preface that these
    maps are not perfect; in fact, I think they''re pretty bad. They can be fun at
    interesting at some points, but sometimes they just aren''t too interesting to
    play through. Speedberry times were gathered by Me, Kayo, and RareBeeph. This
    mod depends on CollabUtils2, and LunaticHelper. I want to also give huge amounts
    of thanks to Flagpole1up, who had designed the Map Entrance and Journal sprites.

  Description: A dashless map that focuses on double jumps, various platforming challenges
    and puzzles.
  Text: 'Sunset Rise is a dashless summit-esque map that utilizes the double jump
    refill which allows the player to jump mid-air. It features a lot of platforming
    and puzzles based around dashless techniques, and a lot of secrets. The map consists
    of: - 60+ rooms - 32 red strawberries - a golden strawberry - a cassette (no B-Side
    right now) - a crystal heart at the end of the map - a hidden winged golden berry
    for everyone who beats the entire map in one sitting - a few hidden easter eggs
    The normal route requires pretty much no tech apart from dream jumping and grabbing,
    however for a few red berries you might need to know a few tricks or game mechanics
    to collect them without much struggle. Neutrals are not required, but they are
    also not disabled, so you can use them if you want. Difficulty is high-end intermediate
    to low-end advanced. The map is harder than 7A and 7B, but is most likely a bit
    easier than Farewell. Special thanks go to aridai, who has fixed a crash bug with
    throwable crystals, and max480 who helped with weird issues regarding loading
    custom graphics. If you''ve found any bugs or issues, feel free to let me know

  Text: 'Did you ever wish celeste''s main levels were harder? Well I did it anyways.
    Welcome another map remixing levels. As for what this map set does, it just takes
    the original level designs and adds many spikes for difficulty, sometimes additional
    hazards and level pieces. You''ll need to know a good chunk of movement to at
    least beat the levels so far. This map set includes... 5 of the original maps
    given additional difficulty. 0, 1A-C, 2A Two additional berries, both of them
    in prologue An ability to return to earlier sections in the A-sides Fun fact,
    1A dashless is still possible! 2B or 3A coming up eventually? The harder the levels
    get, the harder it gets to make it decently interesting. This map prioritizes
    consistency in performance, not difficulty. Disclaimer: this map pack isn''t supposed
    to be extremely hard, but is meant to be generally harder than the base game.
    It is focused on adding new spins by limiting movement to specific routes, sometimes
    using less known movement. The idea is to make it harder, but not unfun.'

    and created a whole new story around it. Story: There is no Madeline in this world.
    Theo wants to climb the Celeste mountain mainly for the photos for his Insta Pix
    account but also because his sister recently died and he wants to distract himself
    by climbing the mountain. But on the mountain he meets someone who looks the same
    as him. The Other Self Dialog German Version A dialog mod that was originally
    uploaded by SSM24 and which I translated into German. Story: The backstory for
    this rewrite is that Madeline made it to the Old Site without meeting Theo, woke
    up, and turned right back around to leave after Badeline''s harrassment. Before
    she left, she challenged Badeline to do better (defensively), and now Badeline

    goes wrong, or if you have questions or suggestions or anything, please ping me
    on discord at tobyaaa#7052 anyway, here''s what the helper has in it: Custom flaglines:
    These are a version of the cliffside flags entity and/or clothesline entity, but
    with a load of customizability options, including changing the flag''s colors,
    spacing between flags, and the size of the flags. You can even make the flags
    appear upside down! Platform Jellyfish (WIP): I dyed a jellyfish purple then hot-glued
    an invisible jump through onto it, so you can stand on the thing now. Entities
    that attach to platforms, such as spikes or springs, will also attach to this
    jellyfish, though some trial and error may be required to place them in the right
    spot in ahorn. This is a work in progress entity that is subject to change. There''s
    a dumb infinite height exploit I have to fix (in theory this isn''t bad but it''s
    not that fun to execute and can be done basically anywhere). I''d also like to
    add respritability support eventually. Don''t make maps with this quite yet, but
    feel free to fool around with it. Custom dreamstars effect: Remember that one
    unused vanilla effect that causes weird green squares to rise up the screen? I
    made a customizable version for that, so you can change the direction of travel,
    speed, color and size of the squares. Don''t like squares? You can also make them
    circles or diamonds! There''s also neat things you can do with them if you make
    them small enough to be only single pixels. The "stars" in the cover image, for
    example, are actually three versions of the effect, with speed of 0 and all different
    color and parallax values. Custom godrays: The pink diamonds that float down the
    screen in Reflection have always struck me as missing a few options. So, I made
    a version where you can change their color, lifespan, size, direction of travel,
    and even what angles their sides have. An added feature is the ability to make
    them change color as they travel along! These in particular were extremely fun
    to make. Custom bossfield: Rounding off the list of custom versions of vanilla
    effects is the background from the badeline fight in chapter 6. Comes with speed,
    color, and direction options, as well as a few others. Summit Boost bg: I''ve
    had my eye on this for awhile. It''s the background that appears during transitions
    between summit sections, and also appears at the start of Farewell, as a styleground
    effect! As is custom this comes with a myriad of options. Flag-based triggers:
    these are versions of vanilla or everest triggers with the added option of what
    session flag must be active or inactive for the trigger to work. All also include
    the option to reset said session flag on a successful activation. These triggers
    include: flag-based light fade trigger flag-based music trigger flag-based dialog
    cutscene trigger flag-based flag trigger flag-based ground refills trigger a flag
    logic gate trigger, which lets you set a session flag if two other session flags
    are some particular combination of values'

  Name: mountain (Dialogue mod?)
  Authors: [Flamecrafter113]
  Description: '"" -anyone'
  Text: mountain Called this because I removed every instance of Celeste Mountain
    ever being called "Celeste." This dialogue mod is more of an ease of access. In
    almost all cutscenes that have text, most of it was removed, leaving just the
    character actions (plus a few delays to keep it working right). Good for just
    seeing what a cutscene does without the pile of text. Opt-in cutscenes (those
    the player can choose whether or not to do) are heavily cut down to just a handful
    of lines, usually making them pretty blunt. Automatics like mini text boxes have
    minor changes or are left unchanged. This includes the very beginning of the game.
    The cutscenes that haven't been stripped to the triggers are the 4A feather minigame,
    6A start, and Farewell end cinematic. These are left as such for fear of breaking
    everything or making stuff nonsensical. The feather minigame in specific doesn't
    break, but it does stall the game behind a couple of button presses regardless.
    Because it is required, it is best to just leave text in. This pack is labeled
    by a cassette. I can also try to update this for certain mods too if requested.

  Name: SSM's Quality of Life Mod
  Authors: [SSM24]
  Description: Small tweaks to make the game feel a little better
  Text: 'This mod simply aims to add some minor quality of life tweaks and features
    to Celeste. Each change can be toggled and configured in the settings. Current
    features: Fast Lookouts: Hold the Speed Up Lookouts button to make scrolling through
    watchtowers much faster. Useful for very long rooms that take a while to scroll
    through. The button defaults to Shift on keyboard and LT on controller, but this
    can be configured. The speed increase is also configurable. Skippable Postcards:
    Hold Confirm for a short time during the postcard sequence to end it early. This
    aims to make postcards less annoying without disabling them outright. (By default,
    enabling this also shortens the waiting period before the C-side postcard; this
    can be changed by editing the mod settings file.) Disable Low Stamina Flashing
    (disabled by default): Madeline will be colored a solid red rather than flashing
    rapidly when low on stamina. Thank you to dabba for the suggestion! Additionally,
    this mod adds some console commands that you may find handy. (You''ll need to
    have debug mode enabled in Mod Options to use the console.) Set Camera Offset:
    Set the camera offset at any time while playing. These can come in handy if the
    camera in a map you''re playing needs adjusting, and you don''t want to wait for
    the mapper to fix it themselves. (But please still let mappers know about camera
    issues!) - camera_offset (or c): Sets horizontal and vertical camera offset simultaneously.
    - camera_offset_x (or cx): Sets horizontal camera offset. - camera_offset_y (or
    cy): Sets vertical camera offset. (Tip: pausing and then opening the console will
    make it much easier to use these in the middle of a room.) If you have any suggestions
    for stuff to add, please ping me on Discord (SSM24#0079) or leave a comment to
    let me know; I want to hear more ideas! I''m looking for minor changes and features
    that serve to improve the gameplay experience without affecting core gameplay
    too much. If you''re not sure whether your idea fits, let me know anyway; if I
    like the idea enough, I might incorporate it into another mod instead...? Other
    "small tweak" mods similar to this one: Vanilla Tweaks by JaThePlayer: Provides
    a bunch of small tweaks to the gameplay experience, very similar to this mod (and
    was somewhat of an inspiration for it). Also includes the feature to skip postcards
    at the start of levels entirely, if that''s more your style. Better Refill Gems
    by myself: Makes no-respawn refill gems visually distinct from ordinary ones that
    do respawn. (I was actually tempted to deprecate that mod and incorporate it into
    this one instead, but other mods already have it as an optional dependency and
    I don''t want to make them update their code.)'

    time trying to make my own styleground and dialog, and trying player clone(unholy)
    of the Pandora''s box. It''s really fun to play with. This map is inspired by
    "Nice Doppelgänger" of the spring collab so it features dual player. It means
    you are controling Madeline and Part of You at the same time and their moves are
    synchronized. If you don''t get the idea, try "Nice Doppelgänger" in spring collab
    or "Hexagon Force" in Geometry Dash first:) It has about 20 rooms and it is supposed
    to be brain teaser and it has some simple technique (dream jump, supers, hypers,
    fast-bubbling, etc.) It also features boxes and pressure plate from Factory Helper
    so that there are some puzzle gameplay in this map. Difficulty: Advanced Red,

  Authors: [sknolls]
  Description: During March 2020, Madeline contemplates leaving her home.
  Text: 'CONTENT WARNING: This mod depicts emotional abuse, transphobia, and anxieties
    around the COVID-19 pandemic. Synopsis: Eclipse takes place several years after
    Madeline climbs Celeste Mountain. It is during March 2020, when COVID is first
    showing up in America, but before the lockdowns happened. Required Tech: Only
    tech taught in the base game is required, so no neutrals, supers, reverses, etc.
    Nothing has been disabled. This also applies to the hearts and strawberries. Hard
    to perform tech, such as corner hops and demo dashes, can be used to cheese parts
    of the mod and skip parts of certain screens. This mod uses several mechanics
    taken from helpers and water. Difficulty: The levels are harder than what their
    tech requirements might imply, especially in Chapter 1. The difficulty curve isn''t
    linear up. Partially for story reasons, mostly because I was having trouble managing
    it, especially in earlier chapters. There are definitely mods that are harder
    than this one, but this mod ended up being harder than I initially intended for
    it to be. I''m not good at judging difficulty, so I''ll update this paragraph
    if I get feedback. Some of the strawberries and secrets are extremely well hidden
    and difficult to find, especially in later chapters. Contains: - 4 Chapters (and
    a prologue) - 64 Strawberries - 4 Hearts - 4 Cassettes The lack of golden berries
    is due to an issue with Chapter 4, where a section will force kill the player
    before entering the cutscene. I could not resolve that issue, but it''s related
    to a room teleport trigger from Contort Helper. If anyone knows what causes that
    issue or knows of a good alternative to Contort Helper, please tell me so I can
    fix it. I would like to particularly thank Cabob and Stotch for playtesting the
    entire mod and giving super detailed and helpful feedback the entire way through.'

    vanilla content. In order to enable these changes, you must use the included "Bounce
    Helper Trigger", generally placing it on the spawn point in the first room of
    each chapter you want them to be active within. Also included in this helper are
    a collection of new twists on vanilla solids; the Bounce Zip Mover, Bounce Dream
    Block, Bounce Move Block and Bounce Swap Block, each with a unique bounce interaction.

    think that shows through in my room design. Still far from completed, and all
    existing rooms and berries are subject to change. As for tech required, you will
    need to know: -hypers -wavedashes -wallbounces -neutrals -buffered climb jumps

  Text: 'The 2020 Celeste Spring Collab is a project that has been in the making for
    over 8 months with 100+ people involved. After waiting patiently for so long,
    we''re proud to present you the final product! The Spring Collab Has: 5 Chapters
    Each with a Different Level of Difficulty 80+ Maps 300+ Rooms 1500+ Hours of Playtesting
    175+ Strawberries 40+ New Music Tracks Dozens of New Custom Mechanics Many, Many
    New Sprites Built-in Speedrun Times The Spring Collab has 5 lobbies for you to
    explore, loaded with maps made by the community. The difficulty of the maps spans
    from early Vanilla content to some of the hardest Celeste maps that exist, providing
    enjoyable content for everyone. Once a Map is beaten, Silver Berries and Speed
    Berries will spawn in its first room. Silver Berries will require you to reach
    the end of the map to be collected, while Speed Berries will time how fast you
    get through the map, and then give you a ranking! (To unlock all berries at the
    start, unlock Cheat Mode in the vanilla Prologue chapter.) Thank you everyone
    who participated in the development of this project, and thank you everyone for
    playing the collab! Because of how the lobbies were developed, using the Debug
    Tools or any unintended mod functionality or debug commands may break the lobbies.
    The Spring Collab 2020 Audio file is a required dependency for the mod, and it
    also goes in the Mods folder like any other dependency. The Everest auto downloader
    will do this for you. The collab soundtrack is streamable on all major streaming
    platforms. The Majority of proceeds from OST sales go to benefit Trans Lifeline.
    You can buy the album here. The remainder of the proceeds will go to support the
    creator of Everest (The program that made this all possible). If you''d like to

  Description: A mod providing useful features for collabs
  Text: 'This mod adds some entities and features that are useful for collabs: Chapter
    Panel and Journal Triggers: those triggers allow you to bring up a chapter panel
    to teleport to a map, or a journal showing your progress in a particular level
    set. This is useful to make lobbies. Mini Hearts: a heart that ends a map and
    returns you to its lobby. You can then use a Mini Heart Door to block progress
    until the player has enough mini hearts (or crystal hearts!) in a level set. Silver
    Berries: golden berries meant for collab entries. You can also drop a Rainbow
    Berry somewhere, that will be unlocked when the player collects all silver berries
    in a level set. Speed Berries: berries that time you against set Gold, Silver
    and Bronze times. If the timer goes above the Bronze time, the berry explodes
    and the player has to restart the chapter (like a golden death). Golden Berry
    Respawn Points: respawn points that are used when the chapter restarts after the
    player dies with a golden, silver or speed berry. Can be used to make golden runs
    less annoying (by respawning after a tutorial section, for example). A few more
    features that aren''t visible in Ahorn, such as hiding level sets from chapter
    select and reskinning crystal hearts on chapter panels You need to install it
    to play the 2020 Celeste Spring Community Collab. If you intend to use the collab
    utils as a dependency for your own map, please read the documentation here. It
    explains you how the entities and features work in more detail, and gives you

  Description: Mishmashing tilesets is fun
  Text: Resting Grounds is my first ever Celeste map, it's quite short and fairly
    easy. Gameplay is slow, but I think it's quite fun. The map doesn't require any
    tech at all, not even a single wallbounce. Still, some sections might be challenging
    for less experienced players. Rooms are mostly very small. The map's design focuses
    on mixing different tilesets, I hope it's not too distracting. There are 4 completely
    different-looking areas. Don't waste your time and don't check every hole or opening
    in the celling. The ones with secrets are indicated in some way or another, or
    can be seen from another room. In this map lightbeams always indicate the way
    of progress that won't let you go back. Lightbeams are used when there are multiple
    paths, so remember to explore everything you can before going to a room with light
    coming out of it. Everything in this map comes from vanilla Celeste, except for
    checkpoint pictures (if that counts). I hope you will enjoy playing my map! (Sorry

    I could with red bubbles, which is the strangeness that occurs when you hit a
    kevin with a red bubble. Thus, Hug A Kevin was born... This is the first map I
    made, and I did it on stream in about 3 hours. Featuring: Jank Many Kevin Hugs

  Text: 'This is a map I''ve made as a small side project. I originally wanted to
    release this as an extra together with my next actual map, but redecided that
    because it''s a very bad idea. This map is a recreation of an I Wanna Be The Guy
    fangame called "I Wanna Atone the Flower" and aims to represent it as accurately
    as possible. Like the original game, this map has 15 gameplay screens, every screen
    being short and symmetrical. You have a double jump instead of a dash and the
    gameplay consists of very precise spike jumps. Disclaimer: Every room was tested
    and is confirmed to be possible, although most of the inputs required are frame
    perfect. If you want to play this map, it is highly recommended to have the Speedrun
    Tool mod to set a high respawn speed and practice a lot using save states. In
    a few rooms this map requires a jump tech that I refer to as "float jumping".
    This is performed by holding jump in midair after a small jump and gives you a
    bit more airtime, allowing you to cross wider gaps with small jumps. Some spike
    jumping tech (cornerjump/cornerkick) is required as well. If you want clear this,
    prepare to spend a large amount of time and effort on that, as this map is much
    more difficult than for example 3L. I myself have currently only actually beaten
    the screens in segments but will definitely try going for it legitimately in the

  Text: '(Finally releasing this? huh.) After a few months of just messing around
    and doing whatever my friends and I think would be funny, I bring this high-quality
    mess that is this mod. This is a partial texture pack with modded dialogue that
    you can change in settings. Be sure to also download The Endscreens for this mod
    that I couldn''t fit in one file. Also download Boomeline for the full experience™?
    Featuring: Actual good writing in like. 2 places. I''m mostly not serious when
    making this but there are exceptions-- Many hours-worth of spritework and custom
    dialogue, all for small, dumb (or not) jokes Custom art, including w a t e r m
    e l o n and other edits This is also where the speenbird emote I made came from
    To do: Change a whole lot of textures. I have a long list im not putting here.
    Finish Dialogue: chapter 3 chapter 4 ch. 6 chat with theo chapter 8 farewell Oh
    and if you have any ideas shoot ''em at me if you''d like. Shoutouts to cupacawfee

  Text: 'Midnight Aquarium is an incredibly difficult aquatic-temple themed Celeste
    map built around Farewell and Temple mechanics. This map works to challenge the

    have intentionally been left up for the audience''s interpretation. CW: S*icide
    and Allusions to Self-Harm For best experience, make sure photosensitive mode
    is disabled and contort flash triggers are enabled. All visual effects are minimal

    is being released; this map was nearly cancelled just a little bit ago, but with
    some good advice and a lot of support from Theta, I was able to rework some stuff
    and get this version out. There was a lot I had planned initially that has not
    made the cut now, but thanks to Theta''s aid and kind words, you all get to see
    the hard work I was able to put into this project. For that I am eternally grateful.
    Also, Theta gives great notes. Here''s his Twitch (https://www.twitch.tv/thetagc),
    Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeXBzXub_8ePw5Bg0N6ISnw), and GameBanana
    (https://gamebanana.com/members/1740265)! Cabob - Main play-tester and the FMOD
    guy. Produced the audio banks and guids after my miserable attempt at understanding
    FMOD led to some really janky mixing and looping. The map would have not sounded
    anywhere near as good as it does now without Cabob''s help. He also helped me
    with some random stuff early on in the process, when I was so clueless I could
    barely understand the wiki. Thanks for helping see this project through! Here''s
    his GameBanana (https://gamebanana.com/members/1734740); give his map Frozen Heights
    a go! 30chad03- Main play-tester and sprite-work for the blobfish (also shout-out
    to Eric Barone, creator of Stardew Valley, and whose blobfish sprite we drew great
    inspiration from). He really helped bring the Blobfish to life with some serious
    re-coloring and reshaping of my shoddy personal model. Here''s his Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCec1UPCCsbVEOsWU5WtdYqQ).
    And of course, thanks to all the other play-testers who helped with the early
    rooms; BigKahuna, Mineman, and Donker19. Further acknowledgements to 0x0ade for
    the creation of Everest and the entire Ahorn team for making this creative venture
    possible, as well as all the creators whose Helpers significantly, well, helped,

  Description: Miscellaneous objects focused on crystals
  Text: 'A helper mod, focusing on adding cool new crystals. These were going to be
    used in my mappack, but I got too lazy to work on that, so I''m releasing these
    publicly. I might be a bit lazy regarding bug fixes, but feel free to report anything
    by pinging me in #modding-feedback in the Celeste server. Time Crystal: A crystal
    that, when touched, stops time for every other entity! Looks pretty cool, I think.
    Fill Crystal: Simple crystal that gives you the ability to dash if you don''t
    already have it. Star Crystal: When used, it grants the player invincibility,
    infinite dashes and infinite stamina for a short period of time. And gives them
    rainbow hair. Tele Crystal: Instantly teleports the player as far as they can
    go in the direction it''s pointing. This has the potential to freeze the game
    if the player never gets stopped, so be careful. Linked Move Blocks and Linked
    Move Block Trigger: A variety of move block that can be linked together in a group
    by giving them a number, and can be remotely activated by activating a trigger
    with that number. Default is just a grey version of a move block that doesn''t
    behave differently from normal move blocks. No Dash, No Grab, No Jump Triggers:
    Triggers that prevent you from performing the associated action when you are inside
    of them. Player Timestop Trigger: When the player enters this, they get frozen
    in time. They can still be pushed around though! Keyberry: A berry that, when
    collected, will open any doors nearby. A 1-up will unlock every door in the room.
    Reset Door Trigger: When entered, it will respawn all doors in the level, and
    the keys or keyberries that opened them. Custom Prologue Bridge and Activator:
    A customizable collapsing bridge! You can control the order they fall in, how
    long between each bridge, and how fast the bridges collapse. Locked Intro Car:
    I hope you didn''t lock your keys inside. Custom Wind Trigger: A fully customizable
    wind creator. You can control the horizontal and vertical speed, create wind cycles,
    and other cool things. Custom Wind Snow: Custom snow to go with your custom wind.
    Choose colors, amount, and visual speed. Note that only custom wind snow visually
    indicates diagonal wind, so if you wanna do that, use this. Bumper Booster: A
    custom booster that launches you like a bumper when you exit it. Trigger Trigger:
    A trigger that can activate other designated triggers based on a flag, or after
    a certain amount of time! Can be chained with several trigger triggers to make
    chain reactions, or create a loop of 2 or more triggers cycling between each other.
    Force Dash Crystal: Another crystal, this one being a forced dash in a specific
    direction. It doesn''t cost a dash, or give any back, and works even in dashless
    levels.'

    - Spikes that don't kill you when you step on them. Falling Crusher - Falling
    Block that falls when you enter the room at a set speed. Static Spikes - Spikes
    that don't attach to moving objects such as zip movers and move blocks! Not So

  Text: 'My first Celeste Custom Campaign: Flavors of Pi This map mainly features
    the custom zip movers from Adventure Helper with some additional mechanics. It
    is around Farewell-difficulty I believe (but no where near as long). Right now
    the map currently features: - 32 rooms of gameplay - 5 Strawberries - Custom Music:
    - Illusion of Gaia: Dark Space - Mega Man 7: Freeze Man The only movement mechanics
    required are wavedashing/extended hypers and wall bouncing. Nothing harder than
    that is required, although things like reverse wavedashes/demos can be used to
    save time. I had planned to add more Strawberry rooms, but unfortunately the school
    semester is about to start and I need to prepare my classes, so this is it. I
    hope to make more maps to add to the campaign in the future, along with a story
    as well, but that will be far far in the future. Since this is my first map, I''m
    sure there are plenty of things I overlooked in uploading this. Feel free to ping
    me on the Celeste Discord Server (Evermar#0437) if you would like to give feedback.
    I want to give major thanks to Bio for making the Synced Zip Mover Activation
    Controller. This was the creative tool that really helped me finish up the map,
    and I appreciate him taking the time to code that up for me when I have no coding
    experience. As of Version 1.0.3, Bio has also added the ability to rebind what
    key/button triggers the Trigger Controlled Zip Movers. You can change this button
    in the Mod Options under Communal Helper. And finally, I want to say thank you
    to everyone in #map_making that answered my questions about making custom maps.

  Text: 'After messing around in Ahorn I found a lot of unique ways to use mechanics
    like ice and water and decided to create a small ice-themed campaign! The music
    is all from the Ape Escape series of games and I made sure the environments fit
    with the music. All 3 chapters have very unique gameplay so make sure to try them
    all. This mod includes: 3 chapters 31 berries 10 custom songs custom resprites
    including berries, the level select card and overworld A mix of vanilla and mod
    mechanics 2 moonberries A lot of secrets The first chapter in this mod is intermediate
    to advanced difficulty with a lot of tech that is learned while playing the level.
    Some tech taught in the level includes: Neutral jumps, Wavedashes, Superdashes,
    Waterdashes, Cloud Spike Jumps, Cloud Hyperdashes, and Cloud Superdashes. Wall
    bounces are not taught and some berries may require other tech. The second chapter
    is advanced difficulty with some more expert level rooms later on. Some tech taught
    in the level includes: Ice block climbing, bunnyhops, reverse wavedashes, and
    reverse Space jam/Dream block tech. Some more advanced tech may be required for
    berries including ultras for the moonberry. The third chapter is expert difficulty
    with some grandmaster tech. There are a lot of strange mechanics which makes the
    difficulty quite a bit harder for players without obscure tech knowledge (most
    players). However the new mechanics work with the theme of the map and shouldn''t
    be too hard to learn. There are multiple secrets that require demo dashing. If
    anyone needs to contact me, my discord is Cabob#0284 I''d like to thanks all of
    my playtesters from the Iamdadbod discord, you guys were a great help and made
    the map much less jank. Theta and RamenTwig get extra special shoutouts for playtesting
    everything in both chapters and for giving very helpful feedback. I''d also like
    to thanks DanTKO for helping with chapters 3''s deco placing things like SNOW
    DECALS (god those are annoying) and more girders. Song credits: Leve select theme:

  Description: Wacky additions that zero people asked for
  Text: 'Yet another grab-bag object mod, made at the request of absolutely no one.
    New things are probably being added every once in a while, so stick around! Floor
    Booster - Like a Wall Booster, but it''s horizontal. The fire mode carries the
    player (NOT carryable entities for now) either left or right, and the ice mode
    is really slippery, and optionally won''t refill your dash when stood on. The
    floor booster also comes pre-packaged with the option to attach to moving platforms!
    Custom Switch Gate - Switch Gates with a couple new behaviors. Crush mode accelerates
    while moving, similarly to an Intro Crusher, and features a configurable length
    of time before it reaches its destination; Shatter mode simply crumbles on the
    spot. Color Switch and Switch Blocks - State-controlled solid blocks, with a rectangular
    switch to toggle between states! Essentially, they''re manually-controlled Cassette
    Blocks, and as such, there are four color states: Blue, Rose, Orange, and Lime.
    Purple Booster - A popular addition, this booster travels forward roughly the
    distance of a vanilla Green Booster, before arcing back and launching the player
    in the opposite direction! Custom Bumpers - Exactly what it says on the tin. Currently,
    there are two new colors: Green, which gives the player two dashes when hit, and
    Orange, which turns into an evil red bumper after being hit once. Automatic Falling
    Block - A block that begins falling upon loading the room it''s in. Works well
    with things like Swap Blocks, vanilla Falling Blocks, and the Switch Blocks from
    this mod. Color Switch Trigger - A trigger that changes the Color Switch state
    manually! Comes with a "silent" option, perfect for resetting the switch state
    upon respawning. Kill Lightning Trigger - A trigger to - you guessed it - kill
    the electricity in the room automatically. Nothing too special, but it has its
    usefulness. If you want to add this helper to your map, use the following text

  Description: A grab bag helper for Celeste modding, with something for everyone.
  Text: 'This is my sort of grab bag helper. It contains all sorts of useful stuff
    you can use for any map, with detailed tooltips and a documentation explaining
    some of the extra details, while being simple and efficient. Things it contains:
    Holdable Barriers: Requested by iamdadbod for Ferocious Sanctuary, these will
    be able to hold any holdable entity (included Modded entities!) as if it is on
    ground, while once picked up becomes intangible. Holdable Barrier Controller:
    This allows the creator to customize the colors and particle direction in every
    holdable barrier in the same room as this controller. Custom Spinners: These new
    custom spinners have more options than ever before: Includes: Custom Directories
    for foreground spinners, background spinners, and custom debris!!, Custom coloring,
    and shatter coloring, Custom Border Colors, mixing color bgtiles, scaling, custom
    texture scaling, the ability to remove that pesky rectangle hitbox, and the ability
    to shatter on dash or on a Flag. (Please read the README for information on how
    to structure this and feel free to ping me to ask about how to set it up, as its
    not the most intuitive system as of now, tooltips coming when I have the time
    to complete them.) Animated Spinners: The real reason I made those custom spinners
    was to let these work properly. These are Animated Spinners, which allow you to
    set animations for your spinners, which can include variations on idly moving
    and upon being collided with by the player. The README will be useful for setting
    this up, or you can ping me to ask about how to structure it. Tooltips will be
    coming soon. Thanks to Scroogle for the rotating spinners sprites I use as example!
    Custom Core Messages: Core Messages are notably weird to work with, so I tried
    to make them easier to customize with these Custom Core Messages. These allow
    you to structure them so they always render in frame, can change depth to fix
    the pause bug (try pausing in game while in the end of Core, you''ll notice Core
    Messages render over the pause menu.) These also give Custom Coloring and Color
    Borders, and give the ability to lock the position (there is a parallax effect
    by default.) Corner Boost Block: This block is a partial fix for Corner Boosts.
    It serves to work as an always-consistent version of the FloatySpaceBlock without
    Corner Correction, and works for all x-position dependent Corner Boosts, with
    y-subpixel dependence not taken into account yet. In the README there is an explanation
    as to how the block actually "fixes" corner boosts. Crumble Jump Thru: This works
    nearly identically to Crumble Block on Touch, except it is a Jump Thru Platform.
    Reskinnable Berry: This is identical to Reskinning a berry. However, because this
    is a separate entity it allows you to make multiple different berries in your
    map. So you can have strawberries and also, say, blueberries. New Custom Blocks:
    Custom Coverup Wall: Gives you the ability to set a transparency to the coverup
    wall and also has a flag attribute to turn it on/off. Custom Dash Block: Adds
    the ability to set a flag upon being dashed into, as well as have a Custom break
    sound, something that is bugged in current versions of Dash blocks. Custom Depth
    Tile Entity: This works like any old solid (Connects to itself like FloatySpaceBlocks)
    except you can change the depth to whatever you like. Complete with a list of
    example Depths. (Depths determine how late something is rendered, with lower numbers
    representing rendering over higher numbers.) Custom Falling Block: This has 4
    directions of movement, acceleration and speed modifiers, and the ability to set
    a flag when triggered as well as when it lands on whatever surface it may land
    on. (Toggles off when falling again, and on when it lands.) Flag Condition Blocks:
    I made this for someone before Max''s Helping Hand released Flag Exit Blocks,
    these work the same. Enter Blocks: Enter blocks are like exit blocks but better.
    Upon the screen loading, Enter Blocks are invisible (or with a set Transparency
    (alpha) value). Once entered they change to rendering with a low (customizable)
    transparency, and once exited, they become a solid block. Rainbow Spikes: Rainbow
    Spikes do 2 things. One, they are colorable. If you want to set a custom color
    spike, just set the Color attribute to whatever color you like, or add a hex code
    for more customizability. Two, and the cooler piece: By leaving the color blank,
    it sets itself to the Rainbow Color that Spinners use. These are further customizable
    with Max''s Helping Hand Custom Rainbow Controller, for all sorts of cool uses!
    Thanks to Dabba for the White Reflection Sprites! Laser Blocks: Laser blocks are
    solid entities that shoot the beams that Badeline normally shoots. They can also
    attach to solids for extra gameplay, with custom timings. These are kind of in
    beta, in that not all of the sprites work the way that they should (specifically
    with modifying the Active Timer). Thanks to KAERRA for the initial sprites! Blackout
    Controller: This is a weird entity. It allows you to control the screen being
    blacked out completely save for a few entities (the actual entity depth is -249900,
    so if you put some entity with depth above that you can render stuff over the
    blackout.) The current list of overriden entities include: Players Watchtowers
    (Vanilla and Playback/Hint Watchtowers only) Player Playbacks Any item that is
    Holdable Also disables all lights and blooms when the effect is set to true. Set
    it to flag for use with other entities. The relevant flag that sets it on/off
    is "VH_Blackout" Custom Player Playbacks: This is a highly requested entity. Custom
    Player Playbacks give you more options to make your life easier for Ghost Player
    Playbacks. You can: Change the delay before the animation starts Set the color
    Change the speed at which it travels (please do not use custom values, and use
    the provided as it can cause artifacts and other jank.) Can be activated and deactivated
    with an Activate Custom Player Playback Trigger. Playback Watchtowers: Another
    requested one. Used in tandem with Custom Player Playbacks "CustomID," Playback
    Watchtowers will activate Playbacks when inside the watchtower. You can also toggle
    them on and off with a keybind found in ModOptions. Hint Watchtowers: This was
    an extension off of Playback Watchtowers which took it up a few notches. This
    is an integrable version of Playback Watchtowers which allows creators to give
    map hints using Dialog Textboxes as well as Playback Watchtowers. You can set
    up to 5 hints per watchtower currently. A Super Custom Room Wrap Controller. Control
    offsets from a room boundary, exit velocity, and toggle wrapping on and off with
    this controller! (Also, you can wrap some entities around the room too :) ) A
    Super Custom Instant Teleport Trigger: It does what you think it does. Except
    a lot more. Exit Velocity modifiers, rotation modifiers, position modifiers, instant
    transitions between rooms, and toggleable lightning (glitch effect coming soon™),
    as well as some toggleability of the trigger itself. Floaty Break Block: What
    if we took a Floaty Space Block and crossed it with Shroom Helper''s Crumble Wall
    on Touch? A Floaty Break Block. Wrappable Entities: If configured correctly,***
    these entities can wrap around the screen just like you do! Perfect for puzzles
    and cool mechanics. Custom Torch: A Custom Color and light radius variant of the
    mirror temple torch Carryable Torch (Torch Follower, Torchlight): Made for a map
    for WhippyorcYT, this light upon touching the player follows the player around
    like a berry before it is collected. This can be used with the Dark attribute
    to make for interesting Gameplay. (Thanks to Nikko for the torch sprite!) Traveling
    Flame + Triggers: A version of the Carryable Torch that moves around to specific
    points. Currently does not have Bezier curve functionality, but its coming real
    soon! Thanks again to Nikko for the flame sprites. Variant Changing Mirror: Is
    self explanatory. Changes the variant of the player to Madeline or Badeline upon
    touching the mirror. Currently the main mechanic in Part of Me. Variant Specific
    Boosters Boosters that only activate if you play as Badeline (or not) Variant
    Refills: Refills that switch between Madeline and Badeline. Can also be toggled
    to refill dashes. Dream Mirror (No Cutscene): Dream Mirror. Without the cutscene.
    Also customizable with different frames, glass (from Variant Swapping Mirrors)
    and Reflection types. Also can come as broken. Curves!!!: Introducing Curve Entities!
    These aren''t quite perfect yet, but they are far enough along I can release it
    confidently. Comes with Curved Platform and Zip Movers, and currently working
    on Swap Blocks, Camera Triggers, and more! Confetti Trigger: Trigger. Make confetti.
    Go poof. Custom Seeker: The big one is now more manageable! A custom seeker that
    delags seekers and add all the customizability. It''s too much! (So I made a "simple"
    one, that is just more manageable.) If you want to make it a bit easier to read,
    there are debug commands to help with making the custom seeker, which creates
    this file (this version is annotated.) Feel free to ping me in the Celestecord
    server for help with it. Custom Seeker Generator: Generates Seekers on a timer,
    with some customizability. I''m open to suggestions on how to add to it. Energy
    Crystal: The newest insanity I''ve crafted. This is a speed storage crystal. Upon
    collecting the crystal you will lose all your speed, and the next time you dash
    you instead get launched at the speed of your dash + the added speed you collected.
    Same Room Teleporters: Sort of an extension onto my Instant Teleport Triggers,
    these allow you to teleport between two places in a room, and has a custom length
    parameter which accurately places the player dependent on the length of the teleporter
    itself. Very janky, but now with tooltips. Redirectable Booster: Orange Booster:
    Enough said about this. It''s a redirectable booster. You cannot dash out of the
    booster, as dashing in the direction changes the booster''s direction. SemiControllable
    Booster: Wind Booster: This is a somewhat controllable Red Booster, which changes
    functionality slightly when wind is present. Still a work in progress, I''m looking
    for comments on this so feel free to ping me on the Celeste Discord about this
    or any of the boosters. Pink Booster: Feather/Seeker Booster: This is a very controllable
    Red Booster which acts like a Feather. It has a slower turning radius than a feather
    and cannot be slowed down, but does not have a time limit. Refill Wall: Refill
    walls is a bigger refill. Super useful when you have a large range to land in,
    but you don''t want cheese in your maps. I''m currently looking for tips on how
    to make it look and feel nicer in game, so please let me know if you have any
    suggestions. In Beta: Animated Spikes: A cleaner formatting to animated spikes,
    now allowing for any amount of frames. Still in Beta. Notes: Note there are guides
    on how to use the Room Wrap Controller and Instant Teleport Triggers here. WIP
    stuff Curved Platforms, Swap Blocks and More! Other suggestions from the community
    and bugfixes, if you have suggestions or issues with the helper, hit me up in
    the Celeste Modding Discord or on Discord @Viv#1113. You can also submit bugfixes

    It also contains these triggers: Camera Target Crossfade A camera target trigger
    that can be used to crossfade between 2 targets. Useful for going from one target
    trigger to the next, or creating special cinematic shots by chaining multiple
    together. Camera Target Corner It''s a normal camera target trigger, except for
    the fact that it has corner position modes! This lets you fade out from a camera
    target trigger in multiple directions, by using this to cover the corner between,
    for example, LeftToRight and BottomToTop target triggers. This would require a
    BottomLeft corner target trigger. Work is happening on these entities: Turret

  Authors: [Bio., catapillie, coloursofnoise, Viv, Anilmky -Nikko-, '0x0ade', max480,
    Cruor, Vexatos, JaThePlayer]
  Description: A collection of new mechanics, conceived of by the community, for everyone
    to use.
  Text: 'This helper is designed to be a collection of new mechanics based on suggestions
    from the community, as well as a place to put any random ideas that we have. If
    you have any ideas for new mechanics/entities that you want to see implemented,
    let us know, and if it sounds cool/doable we''ll add it to the collection. You
    can find us in the Celeste Discord @catapillie, @Nikko, @coloursofnoise and @Viv.
    The current list of included mechanics: Connected Dream Block - Dream blocks that
    when placed such that they overlap, will form continuous regions. The "feather
    mode" option allows the player to control their direction of movement while traveling
    through the block, the "double refill" will give the player two dashes when exiting
    the dream block, and the "one use" option will cause the dream block to shatter
    upon exit. Dream Zip Mover, Move Block, Swap Block, Falling Block, Switch Gate,
    Crumble Block and Floaty Space Block - As the name suggests, each of these entities
    take the movement behaviour of a specific solid, and apply it to a dream block.
    These entities all have access to the same "feather mode", "double refill" and
    "one use" options as the Connected Dream Block. The Dream Zip Mover and Swap Block
    both have access to "no return" modes with the Zip Mover having additional "ticking",
    "permanent" and "waiting" modes, and the Dream Move Blocks & Falling Blocks have
    access to the "no collide" mode, which will allow them to pass through any solids
    other than Dream Blocks while moving. Dream Refill - A special refill that once
    collected, allows the player to dash through any solid, except for dream blocks
    which will kill them. Cassette Zip Mover, Move Block, Swap Block and Falling Block
    - Similar to the dream block types above, each of these entities take the movement
    behaviour of a specific solid, and apply it to a cassette block. The Cassette
    Zip Mover and Swap Block both have access to "no return" modes with the Zip Mover
    having additional "ticking", "permanent" and "waiting" modes. Connected Zip Mover,
    Move Block and Swap Block, Connected Solid Extension - They act like their corresponding
    vanilla version, but they can have any shape, simply by placing Connected Solid
    Extensions so that they touch or overlap, and are tiled automatically. Station
    Block and Tracks - A block that sits on a track, and when activated will move
    along the track to a specific node. The block is activated by dashing into it,
    and will either move toward the side that was dashed into, or away from it, based
    on the "behaviour" option. Track segments are either vertical or horizontal, and
    when placed such that their nodes (ends) overlap, will connect to form full, continuous
    tracks. The block must be placed directly on top of a track node for it to attach
    to the track, and when activated can only move in directions that have a track
    segment leading away from their current node, in that direction. They are also
    reskinnable. Synced Zip Mover Activation Controller - A controller entity that
    when placed into a room allows Synced Zip Movers (from the Adventure Helper) of
    a specific color to activate whenever the player pressed grab. If you wish to,
    you can rebind the key/button of your choice to activate them. (For map makers:
    the Custom Bird Tutorial provided by Everest can now correctly display the binding
    that is used by players, by adding "CommunalHelperSyncedZipMoverBinding" to "Controls"
    in Ahorn). Attached Wall Booster - A wall booster that can be attached to a moving
    solid. Crystal Heart Shards - A crystal heart which is broken into pieces to can
    be scattered around a room, requiring the player to dash into each piece individually,
    in order for the heart to reform at a specified location, and allow proper collection.
    Also ships with a plugin for a sharded version of the AdventureHelper Custom Heart,
    which requires Adventure Helper v.1.4.4 or higher. If you don''t have it installed,
    this plugin will not show up. Summit Gems and Summit Gem Manager - Summit Gems
    that you can actually use for your map/campaign. The Summit Gem Manager entity
    is placed in the room where it checks if all the specified gems are collected,
    and moves the Crystal Heart in the room to its own position, with an optional
    offset. Two additional custom gem texture/sound options are included, and the
    manager also works with AdventureHelper hearts. Move Block Redirect - An entity
    that defines an area and a cardinal direction, and if a Move Block enters the
    said area, will redirect it to move in the specified direction. For a Move Block
    and a Move Block Redirect to properly interact, they must have the same width
    and height, and redirection will only occur once the block fully overlaps with
    the area. The Move Block will normally change direction after a short animation,
    but there is also the option for a "fast redirect", which will cause the block
    to immediately change direction without an animation. Timed Trigger Spikes - Basically
    the same as regular Trigger Spikes, but coming off withing a specified amount
    of time. Move Swap Block - You get it; A Swap Block that''ll travel in a specified
    direction when interacted with. It can swap positions even when it''s travelling,
    and steering can be enabled. Basically Move Block × Swap Block! Reset State Crystal
    - This refill entity will put you back in the default player state when you collect
    it, essentially getting kicked out of your previous state. For example, collecting
    it while being in the feather state will just turn you back to the simple player
    state. Shielded Refill - Simple green and pink refills that need to be dashed
    into to be collected, since they''re in a bubble. Not dashing will bounce you
    off, without regiving you any dash. You can untick the "bubble repell" mode, and
    instead of getting bounced off, you''ll just go through the bubble, without collecting
    anything. To use this helper as part of your map, put the text below into the

  Description: Rainbow hair but better!
  Text: 'A major change was made regarding the way your hair options were stored (since
    it with the current number of options it was getting unwieldy to store it in the
    normal way settings files are stored). Hyperline is a mod designed to provide
    more hair color options for Madeline, allowing you to have shifting and static
    hair colors as well as adjust hair length. It is very similar to other hair mods,
    however hopefully it provides a bit more customizability and still achieve some
    of the same effects as other mods. Madeline can also have different hair colors,
    hair patterns, hair speeds, ect. depending on how many dashes are left. In addition,
    you can also swap between a pattern style hair with (up to) 10 colors, a smooth
    gradient between two colors, or a solid color. There is a fairly basic wiki for
    some information so this page is left more readable: Wiki It will be expanded
    as features are added. Custom Textures: Custom textures allow you to modify the
    textures of Madeline''s hair and bangs. Please check the wiki for information
    on this. Color Format: You can either use the RGB value of a color or the HSV
    value of it. When using an RGB value, use the format RRGGBB Example: FF0044 When
    using an HSV value, use the format HHHSSSVVV Example: 300050045 Mod Compatability:
    Supports up to 10 dashes currently (with the latest update), so it should be compatible
    with MoreDasheline or any other mod that adds more than default dashes. Also adds
    some compatibility for crowns from MaddyCrown, allowing your crown to match the
    color of your hair (this option will only work if MaddyCrown is installed). Tips:/Misc
    If you aren''t quite getting the gradient you want, try using the HSV values instead
    since a lot of darker colors in RGB don''t quite translate nicely. Note: You can
    only edit strings on the main menu mod options (this is a limitation of Everest
    as far as I can tell). Map integration will be coming back soon.'

    mode). It's recommended to have the hair toggle mod and disable madeline's hair
    while using, but you don't have to (it kinda looks like a little bandana). Also,
    not EVERY sprite is changed, so expect weird things in vanilla cutscenes. It'll
    get better when I update it though. On top of the new skin, I included a new portrait
    for the skin, if you want Kiyo as an npc for your mod, as well as another character.
    There are also 3 new npc sprites, and the ever so coveted cakes, in a regular
    and golden variety (you have to call for them in a new Sprites.xml to use, though.)
    Everything in this mod is free to use, so go nuts. I also added some fun lil things
    on some of Kiyo's animations, so look for that.

    and tech the game can offer. (You would not believe how much there is that I can
    go through...) Ch 2: Complexity Library will still include (but is not limited
    to) more ultras, some dashless movement, and corner boosts. Still a lot needs
    to get in. I''d say about 1/4 is done so far, but long breaks can do that. Ch

  Text: 'A grab-bag mod in the making and constantly growing with mechanics! Lightning
    Dash Switch - A special Dash Switch that turns off lightning within the room.
    Pair with a flag trigger with "disable_lightning" to make it global. Shadow Dash
    - A powerup that gives the player access to an invincible dash (NOTE: Green Boosters
    also trigger the Shadow Dash, currently looking for a fix) Shadow Dash Bumper
    - Bumpers that give a Shadow Dash when hit. Also have an option to disable the
    wiggling option. Non-Return Kevin - What it says on the tin. A Kevin that doesn''t
    return to original position after slamming into the wall. Can look like the standard
    variety, but also comes in vaporwave custom recolor variety! Rotten Berry (+ Collection
    Trigger) A new variety of berry to spice up your berry rooms! If you collect it,
    you die. The only way to bank the strawberry is to enter a special trigger. (NOTE:
    Trigger is invisible, sprites for a collection object coming soon.) Snowball Stop
    Trigger - Stops snowballs. Simple, yet useful. (NOTE: Only removes itself if snowballs
    were present beforehand) Item Crystal and Item Crystal Pedestal - A throwable
    that, when placed upon the Item Crystal Pedestal, releases its'' contents. And
    there''s a lot of those: Refill (One Dash, Two Dash, Shadow Dash), Touch Switch,
    Jellyfish, Fireball, Summit Confetti (aka the troll Item Crystal) Seeker Badeline
    Chaser Cloud (Normal, Fragile) Booster (Green, Red) Core Toggle Switch Feather,
    Theo Crystal (aka the double layer Theo Crystal), Crystal Heart ???? Cat Eyes
    - Act like snowballs if snowballs didn''t move. Have custom animations and sounds,
    as well as an option to refill two dashes or the Shadow Dash! Item Toggle Field
    and Trigger - You ever wish to make items disappear and reappear whenever you
    want? By simply putting the field over the entities you want to toggle, and specifying
    what type of item you want to remove (such as Refil, ZipMover or CherryHelper/CatEye),
    you can summon anything you want at any time. The triggers can either enable the
    field with the same Night ID (making them spit out their contents) or disable
    it (making the items currently within the field disappear). Now, the Fields also
    come with an "Assist Rectangle On Solid" option, that places an indicator on a
    removed block (such as a Zip Mover or Space Jam) Custom Teleport Mirrors - A snazzy
    way to reach any place you want! Wanna make the player disappear within a cutscene
    only to reappear in another room? You can do that! Wanna have a cool way to end
    off a chapter? You can do that? Wanna move to a completely different chapter,
    modded or otherwise?! Well, you can do that to, but please read the tooltips in
    Ahorn first. It''s easy to get lost when you''re being taken to a completely different
    location in time and space after all! Door Fields - Gone are the days of unsollicited
    teleportation. Players now want to be able to choose when they''re being teleported,
    even if they don''t know where. With this, you can give them that power! Same
    options as Teleport Mirrors, keep the rules in mind. To activate, press C when
    in the range. Save Data Flag Trigger - A trigger that saves the state of any session
    flag within a campaign. From letting your progress with flags get saved even if
    the player returns to map to letting flags impact other maps in the same campaign,
    you can use this mechanic for a lot of different things! Outline Indicator - A
    handy-dandy rectangular indicator based on the appearence of disappearing crushing
    hazards in Assist Mode with customizable colors! Whenther you want to indicate
    triggers or just decorate your map with cool looking rectangles, Outline Indicators
    (also known as Assist Rectangles) have you covered. Hostile Player Playback -
    A recordable Badeline Chaser! Same rules apply as in normal Player Playbacks,
    check out Kayden''s Commands if you wanna record them! Non-Return Sokobans - Like
    Non-Return Kevins, but they move in the direction you dashed at them, rather than
    the opposite. Inspired by the Sardine7 Sokoban Blocks! To add to map: - Name:

    it to 0.05 internally as setting it to 0 causes weird effects. TL;DR: When you

    with the Strawberry with return! Please read the disclaimer. Disclaimer: Currently
    there isn''t any nodes for a custom placement, so you''ll just move to player
    respawn point. This will be fixed in v1.2! Invisible Light Source Invisible light
    sources are really handy for dark rooms that need some light and you don''t want
    to fill it up with an abundance of torches. You can even change the radius size
    and the color of the light too! Effects Custom Field Custom fields are just like

    Path: This is the path to the particles the effect will grab from. The default
    particle is starfield, which is the normal starfield''s particles. The path automatically
    starts at Graphics/Atlases/Gameplay/particles, so configure your particle sprites
    accordingly. The sprite names must also being from 00.png to 03.png. For example,
    if you wanted to implement a heart-field, you would make a heart folder in your
    .../particles folder and add your 00.png through 03.png sprites into the heart
    folder. In the path, you would put heart. Colors: The colors the particles will
    use. Notice the plural — you can use multiple colors (the particle will grab a
    color by random). To set up, put in your colors and split them up with a comma
    (e.g. ff0000,00ff00,0000ff is for red, green and blue). Custom Dust Custom dust
    are just like stardust from Farewell, but with a lot more customization! Since
    this effect based off of stardust, it is affected by wind (so you aren''t limited)!
    Amount: How many amount of particles the effect will have! This works really well
    with multiple colors, as it looks like there is a lot of effects, but there is
    only 1 being used. Colors: Identical to the custom field''s color.'

  Authors: [AvapXia]
  Description: Celeste Re-imagined With An All New Dash
  Text: 'About a year ago, after i finished my first map (No Gondola) i decided i
    was going to make a campaign similar to the OG game but utilizing the "super dash"
    variant option. Unfortunately my computer stopped being able to run ahorn and
    i didn''t try to pick it back up until now. I am now working on it with a renewed
    spirit and new computer. The Super Dash variant increases the distance of your
    dash and allows you to manipulate its direction mid way through the dash. This
    allows for some pretty neat tricks and concepts that i will try to explore throughout
    the length of the campaign. Make sure you install Isa''s Grab Bag of mechanics.
    This is how the map enables the super dash, i guess if not having it doesn''t
    crash the map you could do it manually but i doubt that will be the case. This
    campaign also features unique dialogue, currently it is structured very similarly
    to the original campaign but i doubt that will be the case for much longer ;)
    This is a WIP campaign, i will be updating it as frequently as i make more content
    (which is frequently right now because i have literally nothing better to do lol)
    Current Progress: -Super City (Forsaken City) is complete -I am still unsure on
    whether i will be doing B and/or C sides for these as the A sides are already
    more difficult than the original campaign -Currently working on Super Site (Old
    Site) -Everest download should be working now! I hope you all enjoy! Fun fact:
    The first level can actually be completed without the super dash variant (similar
    to the no dash challenge in forsaken city) but it''s a lot more difficult and
    requires lots and lots of precise jumps)'

  Description: a grab bag of the psychedelic variety
  Text: 'A code mod of some random stuff that I made into a usable format. A lot of
    this stuff i re-appropriated from my previous maps, Glyph and Sib. The entities
    and triggers here are name spaced separately from those mods so you should see
    no conflicts. In this pack: Entities Attached Ice Wall: Ice Walls found in core,
    but they attach to moving objects, such as move blocks, zip movers, falling blocks,
    etc. The wallbooster variety of this entity is not available as some of the interactions
    can be super jank if not used correctly. If I can fix that behavior I will release
    it in an update. The attachable ice walls are way more interesting though, and
    there''s a lot of interesting rooms that i think can be designed with this one.
    Crumble Block on Touch: Blocks that crumble when you touch them. They will crumble
    after a delay, which is a number that can be set as part of the entity. Useful
    if you want to prevent certain movements in favor of others, like wavedashes in
    favor of extended hypers (this can be done by setting the delay time to around
    0.065) Killer Heart Gate: Heart gates with only one purpose -- to murder Madeline.
    These heart gates also remove any frame freezing so it should be a fluid mechanic.
    Also allows for different colors. Reality Distortion Field: Distorts reality with
    a burst effect. Purely an aesthetic. Probably not much use for this one. Use wisely.
    Shroom Book Interaction (aka Shroom Book): An interactable box that allows you
    to display graphics on the front of screen. Works a lot like the dream poem in
    Old Site. No text is possible, but this mod includes example assets, which should
    guide you in using it properly.The cover image for this mod showcases this entity.
    Has no graphical representation, so use whatever decal you wish. Triggers Time
    Modulation Trigger: Modulates time from one point A to another point B within
    a range. This is similar to the time field in pandoras box, the key difference
    being that everything slows down, including the player, with this trigger. If
    this is set to 0, the game will freeze, so use this wisely please Gradual Change
    Color Grade Trigger: Changes the color grade of the map upon entering, over a
    specified amount of time. The slower the speed, the slower the change. Multilayer
    Music Fade Trigger: Like a music layer fade trigger but with 3 parameters instead
    of one, and allows for all position modes. Really useful if you''re looking to
    do more advanced fmod integrations for your map, involving multiple parameter
    adjustments. For example, this can be used to crossfade between two audio tracks.
    Effects Shroom Petals: Like the normal petal effect, but can be colored. That''s
    it ---- If u run into issues hit me up at beefyuncle#9018'

  Text: 'After 2 months of work I am here to finally present my first map! I put a
    lot of effort into this and it ended up turning out surprisingly well. This is
    a Mirror Temple themed map featuring over 40 screens and a few custom textures.
    The difficulty is estimated to be on the higher side of D-Side level and it requires
    most of the tech available in the game, including: Wallbounces, Hyper and Super
    related movement, Ultras, Neutrals, (mostly limited) different kinds of spike
    jumps and (mostly limited) Cornerboosts. Extended Variant Mode was only used for
    visual effects and doesn''t affect the map''s gameplay. I''m sorry if you''re
    not a fan of such difficult maps, I decided on this difficulty because I didn''t
    expect the map to turn out this well. But according to the people who have done
    playtesting, the map is very fun to play so I''m hoping you''ll find it fun too
    if you consider yourself skilled enough for it. Whenever I decide to make another

  Description: Maddie goes on a journey through the mind & memories of one that are
    not her own.
  Text: 'Hi thanks for playing this map! this was created by marshall (aka beefyuncle)
    (marshall#9018 on discord) I do this for fun and personal development, but I aspire
    to do game development / music for a living someday, and I''d definitely appreciate
    support. You can purchase the soundtrack for this Mod on Bandcamp. If you''d like
    to listen to it for free though, find it on Soundcloud. MAIN MAP INFO ---------
    Maddie goes on a journey through the mind & memories of one that are not her own.
    An impressionistic map that should be suitably challenging for advanced players
    of Celeste. 100+ rooms 30+ berries 1 Crystal Heart...? Lots of ~~~secrets~~~ and
    some (arguably egregious) esoteric shit if you''re into that 30+ minutes of original
    music & SFX lotsa custom codez Difficulty: Around or perhaps slightly more difficult
    than Farewell. Some berries are more difficult than Farewell. If you can beat
    the C-Sides and Farewell you should be able to get through this. I would recommend
    being very comfortable / practiced with wallbounces and wavedashes before playing
    this map, as you''ll likely enjoy it more. Tech required: Wallbounces, wavedashing,
    hypers, etc. Nothing that you haven''t had to do in Farewell or the C-sides. Neutrals
    are disabled. No advanced tech beyond that of the C-Side & Farewell is required
    for full completion SEASONSIDES ------------ Aka Glyph B-sides, but four of them.
    Added as individual chapters following the main map. ~95 rooms across the new
    chapters No berries, no secrets in these, just level. Difficulty: around same
    difficulty or slightly harder than the main experience. I didn''t really intend
    to make harder maps, just wanted to explore some of the concepts of the main chapter
    further here. Tech required: Same as main map. Neutrals are still disabled. VOID-SIDE
    (ALL SEASONS MIX) ----------- The void-side now has a cassette at the conclusion
    of the chapter which unlocks a new level. It''s just more void, if you wanted
    more of that style gameplay you might enjoy these rooms. ~30 rooms No berries,
    though a golden berry challenge does exist. Difficulty: Around the same as the
    other void rooms. Hope you enjoy! Tech required: Same as main map. Neutrals are
    still disabled. ----------- Dependencies: Frost Helper (https://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/9201)
    Extended Variants Mode (https://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/9486) Glyph Audio (https://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/11936)
    DISCLAIMERS ------------ - Neutrals are force disabled via extended variants.
    I did this because I think they sort of ruin gameplay for this map specifically.
    Which is ironic because my first map (Sibs tower) is basically neturals, the map.
    I recognize that this Is controversial, especially for very experienced players.
    But all I can ask is that you approach the map with an open mind! - Debug mode
    will probably break things, use at your own peril - Photosensetive mode enabled
    might make the transitions between rooms a little funky looking but that''s okay.
    I recommend keeping photosensitivity mode disabled if you do not require the feature
    and it is safe for you to do so. - Playing Sib''s Crane beforehand might help
    contextualize some of the content in this map. Though it is not at all required
    (and this map is far more polished anyways). - Yes, if it isn''t obvious already,
    i love fez and hyper light drifter, and i draw a lot of inspiration from those
    games and music. SPECIAL THANKS --------------- + 0x0ade, for not only creating
    everest and being the reason why im doing this at all, but for giving me the ok

  Description: A grab bag of requests
  Text: 'This helper provides a few entities and triggers that were requested, and
    that could be useful for other people as well. Here is what is in the pack: New
    entities: Upside-Down and Sideways Jumpthroughs: platforms you can only cross
    in one direction (left to right, right to left, or up to down). Flag Touch Switches
    and Flag Switch Gates: touch switches that activate a flag, and switch gates that
    listen to a flag. Check the readme on GitHub for more details on their usage.
    You can also customize the delays for the flag switch gate, customize sounds,
    or make the gates come back to their initial position. Note that those have a
    lot of options, but the default values match vanilla, so you just have to adjust
    "Flag" as needed if you don''t need much customization. Flag Exit Blocks: exit
    blocks that only appear when a flag is enabled. You can also make them appear
    or disappear while Madeline is in the room. Grouped Trigger Spikes: trigger spikes
    that all come out at the same time once the player leaves the group. Multi-Node
    Moving Platforms: moving platforms as found in chapters 3 and 4, except they can
    have more than 2 positions, and have more settings (speed, if they should loop
    or go back and forth, etc.) They can also be flag-activated: they won''t move
    if a session flag is not active. Multi-Node Bumpers: bumpers that can move between
    more than 2 nodes, with the same options as multi-node moving platforms. Rotating
    Bumpers: bumpers that rotate around a point. They can also attach to the object
    they rotate around, and move along with it. Multi-Room Strawberry Seeds: strawberry
    seeds that don''t pop when you touch the ground (you keep them even if you die,
    like keys), and can be carried across multiple rooms. They will form a strawberry
    if you collect them all and reach the room where the strawberry is. Kevin Barrier:
    a barrier blocking Kevins, but letting everything else go through. Respawning
    Jellyfish: jellyfish that respawns at its initial position after a small delay
    once it is destroyed (squished, destroyed by a seeker barrier, or fallen off-screen).
    Static Puffer: just like puffer fish, except it doesn''t wave around randomly.
    Temple Eye tracking Madeline: a temple eye that follows Madeline instead of Theo.
    One-Way Invisible Barriers: barriers that you can only cross left to right, or
    right to left. As opposed to sideways jumpthrus, you cannot climb on them, or
    walljump off them. Core Mode Spikes: spikes that change textures depending on
    core mode. By default those spikes look like "cliffside" ones that turn red when
    the core mode is hot, but those are reskinnable like vanilla ones. Lit Blue Torch:
    a blue torch (as found in Mirror Temple), except it starts out already lit...
    and that''s it. Sideways Lava: lava that comes from the sides of the screen (either
    from the left, from the right, or both, like sandwich lava). Sideways Moving Platforms:
    like multi-node moving platforms, except facing left or right! The player can
    go through one side, and grab / climb / wall jump on the other side. No Dash Refill
    Springs: springs that don''t give your dash back when you use them. Customizable
    versions of vanilla entities: Customizable Crumble Blocks: crumble blocks that
    don''t respawn after they crumbled, or that respawn after a custom delay. They
    can also be grouped, so that crumble platforms next to each other crumble together.
    Customizable Refill: refill with customizable sprite, particle colors and respawn
    time. Reskinnable Star Track Spinner / Star Rotate Spinners: star track / rotate
    spinners from chapter 9, except you can change their textures and particle colors.
    Reskinnable Swap Block and Reskinnable Kevin: like regular Swap Blocks and Kevins,
    except you can change all their textures. Customizable Glass Blocks: Glass Blocks
    with customizable background color and star colors. Default values try to replicate
    the colors seen on early Farewell screenshots. When using those, you should place
    a Customizable Glass Block Controller in the room, as this is the one allowing
    you to set the colors. Custom Summit Checkpoints: summit checkpoints that can
    display more than just numbers. You can have minuses, question marks, or make
    your own digits! Golden Strawberry with Custom Conditions: a golden berry that
    can appear even if the player didn''t finish the map, didn''t unlock C-sides yet
    and/or died if you want it to. Custom Sandwich Lava: sandwich lava with customizable
    direction, speed, gap and colors. You can also change these settings mid-room
    by placing a Custom Sandwich Lava Settings Trigger! Reskinnable Floating Debris:
    reskinnable version of the decorative floating debris found in Farewell. Customizable
    versions of vanilla styleground effects: Custom Planets: much like the Planets
    styleground, but allowing to make planets scroll and be animated. Multiple examples
    of custom planets directories can be found in the mod zip, in Graphics/Atlases/Gameplay/MaxHelpingHand/customplanets.
    Custom Stars effect: much like the vanilla Stars styleground, except you can use
    your own sprites for the stars. Snow with Custom Colors: this is the "snowBg"
    and "snowFg" effect, except you can customize the snow colors! Blackhole with
    Custom Colors: just like the vanilla blackhole effect, except you can change all
    the colors, and set its opacity! If you have multiple blackhole effects and want
    to change the strength of all of them, you can use the "Black Hole Strength (All
    Black Holes)" trigger provided with this helper. Northern Lights with Custom Colors:
    northern lights, but with customizable colors for the lights and background. You
    can also remove the gradient background and only keep the lights! Heat Wave not
    affecting color grade: same as the vanilla Heat Wave effect, except it does not
    change the color grade, allowing you to set your own color grade instead. New
    controller entities (invisible entities having effect on a whole room/map): Horizontal
    Room Wrap Controller: drop this controller in a room, and Madeline will reappear
    on the left if she goes off-screen on the right! For this to work, be sure to
    lock the camera horizontally by using a Camera Target Trigger with lerp = 1 and
    X Only enabled. Pulled from Celsius by 0x0ade. Rainbow Spinner Color Controller:
    a controller that changes the color gradient of all rainbow spinners in the room.
    Parallax Fade Out Controller: if this controller is present in a room, the parallax
    stylegrounds that are set to "fade in" will fade out as well in this room. Flag
    Logic Gate: this is a controller (invisible on the map) that allows you to calculate
    a flag based on other flags (for example flag1 = flag2 AND flag3). Useful for
    advanced setups. Set Flag On Spawn Controller: this controller can set or unset
    a flag when the player enters the room it is in, or respawns in it. This is useful
    in (rare) cases where resetting a flag on respawn is necessary, and a flag trigger
    doesn''t set the flag early enough after respawn. New triggers: Strawberry Collection
    Field: a zone where strawberries are collected, even if Madeline is not on the
    ground. The opposite of Strawberry Blockfield, if you want. Gradient Dust Trigger:
    gives the dust sprites in your rooms a color gradient, similarly to rainbow spinners.
    Madeline Silhouette Trigger: a trigger turning Madeline into a ghost playback.
    Madeline''s color will match her hair color. Color Grade Fade Trigger: a trigger
    allowing to fade between two color grades in a similar way as Light Fade Trigger
    (color grade A on the left, color grade B on the right). Camera Catchup Speed
    Trigger: allows to set how fast the camera reaches its target. This is useful
    for really fast sections, where growing offsets would be necessary otherwise.
    Flag-Toggled Camera Triggers: camera offset, camera target and smooth camera offset
    triggers you can turn on or off with a session flag. Pause Badeline Bosses Trigger:
    Badeline bosses will stop attacking Madeline while she sits inside this trigger.
    Speed-Based Music Param Trigger: this allows modulating a music param depending
    on the player''s speed, for example to enable a layer or make it louder when the
    player is fast enough. The change is persistent (the music param will continue
    to be adjusted even when the player leaves the trigger and goes to other screens),
    but you can override/disable this with another trigger. This helper also provides
    support for Animated Parallax stylegrounds. In order to make an animated parallax:
    add all your frames in Graphics/Atlases/Gameplay/bgs/MaxHelpingHand/animatedParallax/YourModName/bgName00.png,
    bgName01.png, etc... if you want a specific frame rate, specify it in the animation
    name by adding XXfps at the end of it: mySlowBackground3fps00.png, mySlowBackground3fps01.png...
    If you don''t, the default frame rate will be 12fps (same as for decals). then,
    set up one of the frames as a parallax styleground in Ahorn as you would for a
    regular parallax. Installing this helper also allows you to reskin the strawberry
    in the game''s menus. If your map is in Maps/yourmapfoldername/map.bin, put the
    strawberry image to use in Graphics/Atlases/Gui/MaxHelpingHand/yourmapfoldername/strawberry.png.
    (You can reskin the strawberry in the level itself by using Sprites.xml, check
    the wiki for that.) The source code of this mod is available on GitHub. If you
    use this helper in your map, you should add it as a dependency. To do that, edit

  Text: 'This is a pack of challenging maps for people who have completed all vanilla
    maps and sides. It is final version and I don''t plan to add more chapters. The
    maps contain: - custom music (only chapter 1) - about 30 rooms (in one chapter)
    - checkpoints - Crystal heart = end chapter - no secrets, no berries - no cassette
    tape (no b-side or c-side) - no story - very very linear maps - Chapter 1 - Space
    Ruins - requires most technical skills (see below) - Chapter 2 - City in the moon
    - a map that utilizes zip movers - Chapter 3 - Temple of the moon - a map that
    utilizes swap blocks and red boosters The difficulty increases as you progress
    on the map, starting from B-side through C-side ending with D-side (final room
    is probably E-side), and requires skills like: WallJump, WaveDash, HyperDash,
    ReverseDash, SuperJump (or DashJump), UltraJump, NeutralJump and more. Demodash
    and Spikejump is not required. Two mods are required. FrostHelper and ShroomHelper
    Sorry for my english.'

    And memes. Right now map pack is not fully complete and will have a lot of updates.
    Contains: 0-3A sides and a 1B (4A is in progress!). Gameplay has a lot of gameplay
    mechanics such as Hypers, Spike and Neutral jumps and other useless shit you will
    probably see in other maps. God help you. Or Devil. Both probably won''t though.'

  Authors: [JaThePlayer, coloursofnoise]
  Description: No more relaunching the game for custom entities!
  Text: 'Note: Mostly obsoleted by Everest''s runtime code mod reloading. Runtime
    Entities is a mod for code modders to quickly test custom entities without having
    to reload the game. It does this by compiling the .cs file of your entity during
    runtime. Usage: In ahorn, place a Runtime Entity. Properties: - Assemblies: The
    list of all assemblies used by your code mod. You can use paths relative to the
    Celeste folder. Note that the following are loaded automatically and don''t have
    to be specified here: Celeste.exe, FNA.dll (if on the fna branch), MonoMod.Utils.dll,
    MonoMod.RuntimeDetour.dll, Mono.Cecil.dll, and all loaded code mod .dll files
    that are not zipped. - cs File Path: The path to the .cs file of your entity,
    can be relative to the Celeste directory - Entity Name: the full name (namespace.className)
    of the entity you want to create. If not set, the first class defined in the .cs
    file will be used. Your entity will be created using the EntityData, Vector2 constructor.
    NOTE: Most likely only works on Windows. This is not a way to replace traditional
    code modding. After you''re done testing your entity, compile it like you normally
    would for an Everest code mod. Do not use this mod as a dependency for your map.'

    when you''re creating a new file, you''ll have the option to create it in Hardcore
    Mode, which cannot be changed later. When a file is in Hardcore Mode, the following
    changes are made: You only live once. If you die, you are brought to a special
    Game Over screen, in which the only option is to delete your save file. (Exceptions
    are made for if the player dies during a no-control state, like a level intro
    or cutscene, as well as the moon berry path in Farewell.) You can only open the
    full pause menu or quick restart if you''re on safe ground. No cheesing! Assist
    mode and debug mode are turned off when entering a file. Variant mode is not outright
    disabled, but all assist options within it are disabled. Retrying is disabled.
    I might be sadistic, but I''m not that sadistic :p There is an icon in the corner
    of the screen indicating that you are in Hardcore Mode. (This can be turned off,
    made partially transparent, and moved in Mod Settings.) The save file slot, area
    complete screen, and journal screen also have Hardcore Mode indicators. Golden
    strawberries will always spawn, since there''s no real reason for them not to.
    You will always go to the golden room in Farewell. Some notes: Your save file
    is deleted the instant you die, not when you actually select Delete on the game
    over screen. The cheat code to unlock all levels is still enabled, and there is
    no attempt to combat save file editing. If you want to make sure your claims are
    believable, provide video evidence! The death count may not remain at 0 for a
    Hardcore Mode file. In particular, Save and Quit will increment the death counter
    (this was done by the devs, not me). So, the death count being greater than 0
    does not necessarily mean that the person cheated. You can quickly toggle hardcore
    mode on/off by using the Quick Restart button on the file select screen, instead
    of having to scroll down and back up to select it. (This can be turned off in
    Mod Settings in case it screws anything up.) If you encounter any weird issues
    or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to ping or DM me (SSM24#0079)

    see it sooner.)'

    English Available in YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqwjZPOmk1A9ExKXJYBZ9R2htuiL6Mbar
    Useful (maybe) tricks guide for players and creators. This Map: It is focused
    on teaching players (and map makers) the different types of tricks that can be
    performed with jumps, dash and hitbox, among others. Players will use these tricks
    to overcome GameBanana''s custom maps and map makers will bring some fresh ideas
    (perhaps) to their maps. I could not catalog what tricks would be more difficult
    than others so there will be no order of difficulty. -Badeline will be the guide
    in this small and unexpected adventure- Content of the maps: A large A-Side map
    of knowledge: - It will teach you from the basics to advanced tricks, used in
    almost all custom maps. - You will learn tricks like: Long jumps, hyper-dash,
    wave-dash, demo-dash, different ways of climbing, stamina, hitboxes, among many
    others. - +30 strawberrys (I didn''t count them xD) both visible and hidden. Strawberries
    make a characteristic sound when you are close, you can be guided by it. (There
    are people who hide strawberries and other secrets well) - B-Side cassette. (hidden
    in a dangerous room somewhere where the laws of physics need to study more history)
    B-Side, Escape from a horrible nightmare, your knowledge will be the key to your
    salvation: - Test your knowledge with difficult tests and challenges - Escape
    from a brutal nightmare ... Or go the fast way - More tricks like: Wall-dash between
    two rooms, ultra-dash, jellyfish fly, duck-climb, move blocks in space jam, skip
    heart doors, blind spots, etc. - Hidden strawberry and others - B side at the
    beginning: If you want to go straight to the tricks, go left and climb the wall.
    You must reach the part indicated above the tree C-Side One Screen Challenge (impossible
    for anyone to overcome):- If you lose, you will return to the beginning of the
    map, without exception. (without checkpoints) - Get ready to get frustrated and
    cry - Good luck. It is all I can tell you. There is still time to go back - It
    is based on all the tricks so far shown - C-side fun facts: If you lose you will
    return to the beginning of the map OMG. The original size was going to be 500x500,
    then it became 300x300 and finally 300x200. It was going to be too difficult.
    It focuses on several tricks and hence the difficulty CH2: Tricks Room - Tricks
    room: Learn various curiosities about the game, away from the topic of tricks.
    7 seconds or less to touch all switches, you are warned. No one said learning
    was easy. Except library rats. Good luck and I hope this is useful for you If
    you find any bug or abnormal situation, do not hesitate to report it in full detail,
    keep in mind that the map is large. Reality: Naturally, after so long playing
    this wonderful game, it has finally bored me, not even mods can give me a second
    opinion. I just hope you enjoy this game to the fullest, it has a lot to give.
    And the community of this game is really amazing.'

    on Twitch under the age of majority may only make purchases with the permission

    where the viewers vote on actions that happen to the streamer. Viewers vote with
    their Channel Points or donate bits to bypass the vote limit. This mod is still
    in beta phase, so there might be bugs! Please report them to me! Known bugs: If
    you start up the game with the mod disabled and enable it, you have to restart
    the game These will be fixed soon! Commands: Die: outright kills the player. Blur:
    makes the screen blurred. Bump: bounces the player in a random direction, restores
    dash. Seeker: spawns a seeker at a random location in the current room. Mirror
    (timed): the level is mirrored. Kevin: spawns a Kevin block above the player,
    it will attempt to squish the player. Disable Grab (timed): grab is disabled.
    Invisible (timed): the player is invisible when moving. Invert (timed): left/right
    controls are inverted. Low Friction (timed): tiles are slippery! Oshiro: spawns
    an angry Oshiro! Snowball: spawns a snowball in the level. Double Dash: gives
    the player two dashes. God Mode (timed): makes the player invincible. and maybe
    a hidden command? Fish: spawns a blowfish in the level at a random location. Wind:
    spawns wind in a room! This command has parameters, examples: !wind left, !wind
    right, !wind up, !wind down. This uses a voting system, example: if you have 5
    votes and 3 of them are left, 2 of them are right, the wind will go left after
    the last vote. Feather: spawns a feather exactly where the player is. Configurations
    for streamers: Install the mod like you would any other Celeste mod, use the Everest
    one-click installer. You can also manually install the mod by downloading the
    .zip and putting it in your Celeste/Mods folder. After this you start up the game
    and set up your desired options. This mode does not require channel points, you
    can turn the "Require Channel Points" option off in the mod settings and you will
    be able to use normal Twitch chat. To set up a custom channel point reward go
    to https://dashboard.twitch.tv/u/YOURTWITCHNAMEHERE/community/channel-points,
    click on "Manage Rewards", and then on "Add New Custom Reward". My custom reward
    looks something like this: Make sure you require viewers to enter text, or they
    wont be able to input commands! After this you can you back ingame, connect to
    your own twitch channel and start playing the game. Viewers will now be able to

    and Monika's D-Sides pack.
  Text: 'UPDATE: The map pack is now compatible with the Celeste randomizer mod, you
    can download the dependency here! A lot of credit goes to Mnstrman06 who set up
    the script for the randomizer. NOTE: Due to name changes in the .yaml, Everest
    might not be able to auto-update it from the launcher. Be sure to download the
    newest version of the CC-Sides manually in order to fix that issue. The CC-Sides
    pack (or Double C-Sides, however you wanna call it) is a pack of challenging maps
    that at first was supposed to be my own take on the idea of C-Sides, eventually
    ending up as a decent middle ground between the vanilla experience and the crazy
    challenges of D-Sides. The difficulty of the rooms stay at around C-Sides to D-Sides
    difficulty. Because I thought the length of vanilla C-Sides was limiting the creativity
    of their levels, I decided to create my own layout for them: - 5 normal rooms,
    usually quite short, they often introduce the player to the gimmicks of the chapter
    - One long room which is mostly a summary of the gimmicks from previous screens
    - A medium length 4 color cassette room with a Crystal Heart 7CC and 9CC are an
    exception, with them being longer than the usual CC-Side. It''s recommended to
    have Everest v1.1701.0 for it to work 100% properly. DJMapHelper and Adventure
    Helper are required for some small game changes. In case if you are stuck on a
    section or you''d like to have a sneak peek of the levels, here''s a playlist
    that I''ve recorded: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCJOnnFub23_GH4TD-ci2JmvsGLVmCSJJ
    Due to the fact I record when I''m about to update the page, some of the levels
    might have been altered a little bit in future updates, so keep that in mind in
    case if you see something that''s slightly different on the video. _______________
    Every CC-Side except 7CC and 9CC requires only tricks that are taught in the vanilla
    game. 7CC has occasional super dashes, while 9CC teaches how to do ultras and
    bunnyhops. No neutrals are required. All chapters also have a Golden Strawberry
    if someone crazy enough decides to ever do them deathless, however due to how
    Golden Berries work, you might need to use Debug/Cheat Mode to activate them.
    If you manage to collect a Golden Strawberry, hit me up on Discord (Ezel#5709)
    with proof (video, stats, etc.) and I''ll consider adding your entry to the official
    list of deathless completions. Link to the list: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14d1iMawFcNwJsYAA2C0C4vO1QqLR0N9Go1dnGUyHg9Q/edit?usp=sharing

  Authors: [canadianclimber, The(Dav)Smasher]
  Description: Ultras are not scary but are very fun.
  Text: After completing most of the custom maps out there I really wanted to make
    something new that would have my favourite kinds of techniques so I threw a couple
    of screens together. They were functionally about the same to this but with black
    backgrounds and straight line platforms and literally zero decoration or aesthetics.
    Luckily Dav came along and made them into something more sane and appealing so
    that hopefully someone other than me would want to play it. I'm really happy with
    what we've made. A large move dynamic speedy map that is a blast to play. This
    map REQUIRES ULTRAS. An ultra is performed by dashing diagonally into the ground
    from a high speed and sufficient distance. If you dash from too close you just
    perform a wave dash and will only get wave dash speed. If you dash from far enough
    away and jump at the correct time you will get a boost and perform an ultra. Ultras
    can be done from getting launched by zippers, swap blocks, or just from doing
    a hyper or wave dash. The faster you were going when performing the ultra the

    I can be proud of! Spoopy''s Laid Back Level Pack 2.0! - Now with at least 67%
    more map on each map! - An entire new chapter! - Updated gameplay - Better-flowing
    rooms that are easier to read - More camera triggers - Actual stylegrounds~ -
    Old versions of the maps are now the B-sides, look I like to keep things on record.
    - New dependencies sorry If anything just play the new chapter because it''s by
    far the best one! :] Note: I recommend playing this with photosensitive mode turned
    on, some effects make it a bit hard to see in at least one section. Old description:
    I downloaded ahorn one day and over the span of a week I spent all my free time
    making stuff I thought was fun. 3 chapters, no story between them, just a laid-back

    asking. Check out a recording of the full map here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0QOLt_d4TE

  Text: 'This is a project I''ve been working since a while but never have gotten
    around to upload it. With the help of a few people, here it is, a Polish translation
    file for the vanilla Celeste. Everything is subject to change right now, so if
    you''ve found any errors that we might''ve overlooked, or want to help improving
    the translation, hit me up on Discord: Ezel#5709. You can also contact me if you''d
    like a mod to be translated, or dialogues in custom maps. Special thanks go to
    NajekK and YellowRelic3714 who helped me with correcting and playtesting the translation!
    __________________________________ How to install? Disclaimer: Since it has been
    only tested on a Celeste copy with Everest installed, if you have problems with
    the files working, you might need to install Everest for it to fully work! In

    name):/Program Files/Epic Games/Celeste/Content/Dialog Put the Polish.txt file

    progress to the next room and there's always some different catch; it definitely
    isn't a traditional map, I'm pretty sure there are no other maps like this. There
    are 9 battle rooms in the A-Side, going to be 5 in the not finished B-Side, and
    3 planned for the C-Side. This map was inspired by a room in nameguy523's Reflection

  Description: ''
  Text: 'Factory Helper This entity pack contains a fair few new entities. To help
    out anyone who wants to use these entities in their own mods, I have created this
    documentation on the github page of the mod. You can also check out the source
    code there if you want. This mod was created for Shrouded Thoughts (click to navigate
    to it). It contains the following items: Pistons: They can face all four of the
    cardinal directions and move between point A and B at frequencies you can set.
    Heated pipes kill the player if they grab them or stand on them. Can be toggled.
    Boom Boxes: Grabbing on standing on these will launch you after a short time,
    followed by a short reset period. Can be toggled. Dash Negators: Initiating a
    dash in the field of these will shoot you and kill you instantly. Initiating a
    dash outside of the field and entering afterwards is safe. Can be toggled. Wind
    tunnels/Fans: Fans are purely aesthetic, but wind tunnels act like localized wind.
    Strength can be set to any value and they can face any of the four cardinal directions.
    Can be toggled. Electric Walls: Generally act like spikes, except they can be
    toggled. They also are omnidirectional hazards, so no going through them from
    any direction, regardless of their facing. Conveyor Belts: They are horizontal
    solid entities that carry the player and crates in the direction they move. Can
    be toggled. Crates: They come in two varieties: metal and wood. Metal crates are
    only destroyed when touching spinners (or killer debris) while wooden crates are
    destroyed whenever they hit a surface too fast. They can be spawned from outside
    of the level bounds using a spawner entity, which can be toggled. Can have the
    Special attribute which respawns the player at the crate''s origin once the player
    dies or the crate is destroyed, even if it happens in other rooms. Leaving the
    crate behind removes this effect. Can also have the Crucial attribute which kills
    the player if the crate is destroyed. Dash Fuse Boxes: They can toggle the state
    of other factory items if you dash into them. One time toggle. Breaking one refills
    your dashes. Battery/Battery Box: The boxes can toggle the state of other factory
    items when you bring a battery to them. One time toggle. Batteries act like keys.
    Pressure Plates: They can toggle the state of other factory items as long as there
    is an actor on top of the button. (For example the player, crates or Theo) Steam
    Wall: Can be summoned by a Spawn Steam Wall Trigger. It will move towards the
    right, starting from the left side of the camera when entered. The steam wall
    will destroy crates it touches and deactivate all factory entities except for
    Boom Boxes, which automatically get activated and launch the player as soon as
    the wall hits them, even if they were inactive before. Machine Heart: When destroyed
    by dashing into it twice it destroys all dash blocks in the room and summons a
    Steam Wall after 2 seconds. Also initiates the Escape music. Power Lines: They
    are used to indicate what toggling entity is connected to which togglable entity.
    They are not required for the logical connection, only serve as visual indicators
    for players. You can give them a hex color to differentiate power lines when multiple
    connections are present in a small space. Can be toggled. Rusty Lamps: They are
    power sources that have different strobe patterns and can be toggled. Killer Debris:
    Basically spinners, just made out of scrap metal. Come in bronze and silver variants
    (brown and grey respectively). Rust Berry: Special collectible akin to the Moon
    Berry that does not show up in the total number of berries but adds to the count
    when collected. Factory Activator Dash Block: Acts like a regular dash block in
    every way, but when broken, it activates factory activated entities using their
    factory id. Factory Activator Trigger: Toggles other factory entities when entered.
    Can be permanent or room only. Can require an activation id to be active. Permanent
    Activation Trigger: When placed on an exit, extending well into the next room
    it makes all activation ids specified in it permanent. Used for activations where
    you want them to reset if you die, but stay active if you finish a room. Factory
    Event Trigger: Used to initiate cutscenes from Shrouded Thoughts. Special Box
    Deactivation Trigger: Removes the Special attribute from crates. Spawn Steam Wall
    Trigger: Spawns a Steam Wall at the left edge of the camera. Other: Rusty spikes,
    rusty doors, textures for rusty crumble blocks. Also contains: Custom music by
    Mastar! A custom gear screen wipe. Some custom components that may be used when
    extending the mod (only relevant for modders who want to make their own factory
    items). An end screen and area icon for Shrouded Thoughts that can also be used
    for other maps if map makers want to. A few custom backgrounds for the factory
    setting as well as the factory tileset and decals.'

    by BeefyUncle. please leave a comment / feedback here if you enjoyed the mod or
    had any thoughts about it! <3 disclaimer that chapter 2 of this mod is really
    the hottest of garbage (it was my first map), don''t play it! As a preface, its
    worth noting that I don''t desire for these two chapters to be played sequentially.
    There''s no concrete story, so play either one first, depending on your wants
    or playstyle preferences. This readme serves to help inform that decision for
    you. Here''s some rough cuts of the music from Chapter One if you''d like to listen
    to the music independent from the mod! -------------------------- CHAPTER ONE--
    SIB''S CRANE -------------------------- x30 strawberries, x1 crystal heart, 46
    rooms Difficulty: Mid-B to Mid-C range, Skills required: Fast movement under pressure!
    Lots of Hyper Dashing, Wavedashing, extended hypers, walljumps. No neutrals required.
    Perhaps some orthogonal thinking as some mechanics / rooms are used in strange
    ways. -------------------------- SIB''S CRANE B-SIDE --------------------------
    x1 Berry (Golden), x1 crystal heart, 10 rooms (though the last one is very large)
    Difficulty: Definitely harder than any of the C-sides. I think it''s really hard.
    Especially the last room. Not for the faint of heart so you''ve been warned. And
    hey that''s why it''s a b-side! Good luck. Skills required: This map is essentially
    a showcase of reverse hypering. Reverse hypering or reverse wavedashing is required.
    Programmatic does a really good overview of the reverse mechanic in this video
    Basically, If this looks fun to you, then you may enjoy this... maybe. --------------------------
    SIB''S CRANE C-SIDE -------------------------- x1 Berry (Golden), x1 crystal heart,
    3 rooms -- special thanks to canadianclimber for playtesting! Difficulty: The
    last room is harder than anything in sibs crane b-side i believe. This map is
    a showcase of reverse wavedashing. Skills required: Reverse wavedashing, reverse
    extended hypers, wall jumps, etc. -------------------------- CHAPTER TWO -- SIB''S
    TOWER -------------------------- this was my first map, keeping it here for posterity
    purposes. but be forewarned that it is not good. in fact, one might say it is
    hot garbage. but its my hot garbage <3 x18 strawberries, x1 crystal heart, 31
    rooms **No Cassette Tape, No B-sides, No Golden Berry Difficulty: High-C range.
    Skills required: neutral jumps (lots of em...), wavedashing/extended hypers, walljumping,
    use of the ''retry'' option in the menu as some rooms may become unpassable given
    certain actions. Uses heart doors as a mechanic. **Heart Lag issue is Fixed**
    --------- BACKSTORY --------- The forsaken city was once a thriving home to many
    industrial & corporate interests. As the city was abandoned, so were the realized
    dreams of a multi-million entity known as Sib. While his dreams died with the
    city, ambitions remained; turned towards unlocking the mysteries of the mountain,
    repurposing it for his own sake. While his tale remains shrouded in mystery, some
    have attempted explore the darker corners of what remains. They say that those
    who do, despite best efforts, end up no farther than where they began. Even more,
    the few who have made it through never really came back the same as before...

  Text: This is my first mod for Celeste (or any game really), but I think it turned
    out quite well. The Farewell C-Side is a short but very difficult map that will
    test your mastery of the mechanics introduced in Farewell. You will be expected
    to know how to perform a "jellyvator, " which is an advanced technique that can
    be used to gain lots of height with a jellyfish. To do this, hold down when releasing
    the jellyfish, and Madeline will drop the jelly without throwing it horizontally.
    Then, dash up into the jelly to gain lots of vertical speed. There are also a
    few instances where you will need to drop the jellyfish without dashing into it
    immediately, so keep that in mind. Any feedback is appreciated, as this is my
    first modding endeavor and I want to improve!

  Description: The First Do-It-Yourself Platforming Experience
  Text: Introduction This map contains a few rooms worth of challenges that require
    you to tweak the mechanics of the game. There's a couple of optional challenges,
    one being a separate room off the beaten path, and another being a strawberry
    you can only get if you don't use your dash at all during a later room. Difficulty
    is about 3/5, mostly in figuring out what settings to use rather than execution,
    but it's hard to judge and some settings may cheese things. DependenciesEverest
    and Extended Variant Mode are required to play. Honor Rules These cannot be enforced
    in-game, but are limitations of the player I've designed around and should be
    followed to get the intended experience. 1) Don't increase the number of dashes

  Text: After having reached the Summit, Madeline wakes up in a place she knows by
    heart, but something's off... Everything seems so different... and difficult...
    This campaign is composed of (by this time) the map "Fallen Treasure"; Can you
    find your way through this strange underground fortress and find what's in it?
    Good luck...; and "Rising Mentality"; Challenge yourself to test what makes sense
    and what does not... as you climb out of your own fall... This pack includes several
    vanilla concepts combined in different ways, providing hard puzzles to accompany
    the story. Chapter 2 includes an original song by myself, titled "Scaling a Chasm",
    which can be found in my SoundCloud, https://soundcloud.com/astral-aftermath-studios.
    BeefyUncle helped by adding synths and adding it to FMOD. I hope you enjoy this
    campaign, its challenges, and the story. Although some credits have been given
    for people who have helped with ch3, it still isn't ready to release. Ch3 will
    release both as a part of this campaign and as its own map (meaning a "dual release"),
    so more people can play it when it's out. For now, enjoy chapters 1 and 2.

    a cassette and a crystal heart for you to find. There is no B side for this chapter,
    as with the rest. The cassette is simply or completion's sake. This particular
    stage has a dependency on DJMapHelper (v1.6.4) by DemoJameson and HigashiD (whose

    mechanics as well. You can find the source code here. Current items: - Multiple
    node track spinners: they come in both blade and dust sprite form. You can add
    an arbitrary number of nodes and after the final node the spinner will return
    to its origin. They also have extended functionality even if only used for two
    nodes, as you can also set the travel time and the pause time at nodes to truly
    customize your spinners! - No return zip movers: they work like regular zip movers
    except they stop at the end point. When you touch them again they will snap back
    to their original position. - Linked zip movers: whenever a zip mover of the same
    zip line color starts moving it signals all other zip movers of the same color
    to start moving. Can combine returning and non returning zip movers. Colors are
    in RGB hex code. - Custom crystal hearts: you can add a crystal heart from any
    side or even ones with custom colors or even sprites. Custom sprites require an
    understanding of how Sprites.xml works. You can set an RGB hex color to just tint
    a custom grey heart sprite by Nikko (code by Coloursofnoise). - Outro car: outro

    difficulty. Be warned you will need to know how to perform Space Jam jumps, but
    any other advanced movement or speed techniques are not necessary. I hope you

  Text: 'This mod, as its name suggests, adds a simple meter that shows you how much
    stamina you have at any given time! Useful for testing maps, practicing strats,
    or just getting a better feel for how the stamina system actually works. There
    are two meters provided: a small one near Madeline, and a larger one near the
    top or bottom of the screen. Each one can be toggled on or off individually, and
    their positions can be customized to an extent as well. New in v1.2.0: You can
    also customize the colors used by this mod. The colors for normal and low stamina
    can be changed in Mod Settings while not in a level. The fill and outline colors
    are hidden from mod options and must be manually changed (in Saves/modsettings-StaminaMeter.celeste),
    as I don''t see those settings being particularly useful. All settings use hex
    color notation; if you''re unfamiliar with it, you can just use a color picker
    (like Google''s color picker) and copy the hex value. If there are any problems
    with the mod, or if you have any questions or suggestions, please ping or DM me
    on Discord (SSM24#0079). Also, if you want to learn more about stamina in this

  Description: Like Variant Mode but taken way too far
  Text: 'A code mod allowing to destroy Celeste change some things in the game mechanics.
    Adds some options to the Mod Options menu: Gravity and Max fall speed: can be
    used together to create a "space" effect, where falling is slower Jump height:
    control the max height of Madeline''s jumps Horizontal speed: affects all horizontal
    movement when going around Swimming speed: changes the speed cap when Madeline
    is swimming inside water Stamina: affects the ability to climb and grab Dash speed
    and Dash duration: allows for faster and/or longer dashes Dash count: disable
    dashing or give Madeline up to 5 dashes (also affects refills) Ground friction:
    make the ground more or less slippery everywhere Air friction: makes steering
    in the air more or less quick... setting this to 0x makes it impossible to steer
    left/right in air. Disable wall jumping and Disable climb jumping ( in case you
    want to make Celeste not Celeste anymore ) Disable climbing up or down: you can
    still grab walls, but won''t be able to climb up or down. You can still go up
    by climb jumping (unless you disable that too). Jump count: removes your ability
    to jump or gives you the ability to jump again in midair (Refill Jumps on Dash
    Refill will give you back your extra jumps whenever you get your dash back) Upside
    Down: this flips the game upside down. Much like the Mirror Mode variant, but
    vertically. Hyperdash Speed and Wallbouncing Speed: controls the speed of hyperdashes
    (stacks up with X speed) or wallboucing (stacks up with jump height) Explode Launch
    Speed: Modifies the speed given by bumpers, puffer fish and respawning seekers.
    Boost Multiplier: Makes the speed you get from jumping from a moving block smaller
    or bigger. Disable neutral jumping: Prevents you from using that technique to
    climb walls without losing stamina. Neutral jumps now behave like normal jumps!
    Badeline Chasers Everywhere: Get Badeline to chase you on every screen in the
    mountain! (with customizable number of Badelines and delay because why not) The
    "Affect Existing Chasers" option will also modify the number of Badelines on screens
    where there already are chasers, like Old Site in the base game. except in the
    screen where you first encounter Badeline because that would trigger the cutscene
    10 times at the same time Badeline Bosses Everywhere: Spawn up to 5 bosses (from
    chapter 6) in every room of the game. The first boss will spawn in the opposite
    side of the room (this is customizable though), the other ones at random positions.
    Each boss can have up to 5 different positions before disappearing. You can customize
    the bosses'' pattern, and also apply this pattern to existing bosses. Oshiro Everywhere:
    Have Oshiro (or even multiple Oshiros) attack you on every screen! You can also
    disable the slowdown Oshiro triggers if he gets close to you. Wind Everywhere:
    Adds wind to every screen. Also replaces wind on screens where there is already
    wind. Snowballs Everywhere: Add snowballs to every screen etc etc (you can also
    set the delay between two snowballs!) Add Seekers: This adds seekers in random
    locations on every screen. (If the screen already contained seekers, those will
    add up.) You can also disable the slowdown effect the seekers trigger when they
    get closed to you (this only happens in some levels though). Theo Crystals Everywhere:
    Whenever you respawn, a Theo crystal spawns with you. You can''t change screens
    unless you hold it! Rising Lava / Falling Ice Everywhere: Makes "sandwich lava"
    (this is the internal name for this thing) appear in every room, with customizable
    speed. Dashing makes it switch from lava (up) to ice (down). Regular Hiccups:
    Exactly like the vanilla variant, but you can set the hiccup frequency instead
    of having a random delay between 1.2 and 1.8 seconds. You can make it go down
    to 0.1 second. Except you shouldn''t. (If you also enable the vanilla Hiccups
    variant, they will stack up and you will get twice the hiccups.) You can also
    modify the hiccups'' strength. Ability to enable or disable visual effects in
    the game at will: Room Lighting: Set the lighting of all the rooms in the game.
    In case you want Golden Ridge to be dark and Mirror Temple to be bright. Background
    Brightness: Room lighting doesn''t affect backgrounds in this game. This variant
    allows you to turn down the background brightness if you''re going for darkness
    in levels like Golden Ridge. Foreground Effect Opacity: Changes the opacity of
    all effects and stylegrounds appearing in the foreground, in front of Madeline
    (like snow or dust). Disable Madeline Spotlight: Prevents Madeline from emiting
    light. That''s some way to spice up the Invisible Motion variant for example.
    Room Bloom: Gives all rooms the "bloom" effect, or remove it. If you don''t know
    what bloom is ( I didn''t either ), check the screenshots Glitch Effect: That''s
    the effect used when hitting a Badeline boss or in the "void" section of Mirror
    Temple (where you control a seeker). Anxiety Effect: That''s the effect that is
    used when Oshiro is attacking, among other things. Here, Madeline is the anxiety
    source! (Yeah, literally. That''s a thing in code.) Blur Effect: Just blur out
    the whole screen. Zoom Level: Zooms the game in or out for more challenge! Color
    Grading: Apply any of the "color grades" from the game (for example, the ones
    from Core, or from the credits), but also the "Tetris" color grade from the "Celsius"
    map by 0x0ade, and some special original ones. Dash Trail All The Time: This allows
    you to keep your dash trail / after effect all the time, not only during your
    dash. Friendly Badeline Follower: Badeline will float behind you, similar to what
    happens in credits. Everything is Underwater: All levels are now water levels!
    You get to swim through Summit for example. Force Duck on Ground: Exactly what
    it says, you have to duck whenever you touch the ground! Invert Dash: Dash right
    by pressing Left + Dash. Dash Direction: Prevent yourself from dashing diagonally,
    or on the contrary, only allow diagonal dashes. Invert Grab: Grab on walls by
    not pressing the Grab key. And you have to press Grab if you don''t want to grab.
    Invert Horizontal Controls: Pressing Left makes Madeline go right. Bounce Everywhere:
    Bounce each time you hit a surface, like if there were springs everywhere! Held
    Dash: Your dash continues until you let go the Dash key. All Strawberries are
    Goldens: Strawberries won''t collect until you finish the level, and dying with
    one will send you back to the first you collected. Don''t Refill Dash on Ground:
    Reproduces what happens in Core. Falling on the ground won''t give your dash back.
    You can also use this option to get ground refills in levels where you don''t
    normally have them. Game Speed: Like the vanilla assist/variant, but it goes down
    to 0x and up to 100x! This stacks up with the vanilla variant if you enable both.
    Jellyfish Everywhere: Have a jellyfish spawn above you on each screen if you don''t
    already have one. Steering Speed for Super Dashes: turn quicker or slower in the
    air when you have the Super Dashing variant enabled. Screen Shake Intensity: just
    in case you want super screen shake for some reason. Seizure warning on this one!
    This can be extended by downloading other mods: Get DJ Map Helper to add a Reverse
    Oshiro Everywhere option to Extended Variants! Get the 2020 Celeste Spring Community
    Collab or max480''s Helping Hand (1.6.0 or newer) to add a visual option called
    Madeline is a Silhouette, allowing you to play as a ghost playback. This mod also
    includes a Variant Randomizer. You get a big bunch of options for that too: pick
    which variants are randomized and which are not (looking at you Invisible Motion).
    change variants every X seconds or on each new screen just change one variant
    at a time or replace everything each time with Reroll Mode gradually disable variants
    if you get stuck on a room have the list of enabled variants displayed on-screen
    while you play More to come if I get more ideas. If you have some, just ping me
    on the Discord server! Also includes entities and triggers for use with maps:
    trigger the variant you want when you want on your map by using the Extended Variants
    Trigger. Check the README-Mappers.txt in the zip file for more details. Please
    read it if you want to use the trigger, as some of the settings work in a rather
    counterintuitive way. give the player extra midair jumps with Jump Refills. Recover
    Jump Refills give the player back their midair jumps (much like vanilla refills
    do with dashes), while Extra Jump Refills gives more jumps to the player, even
    if that exceeds the Jump Count variant setting.'

  Authors: [DemoJameson, _bella_]
  Description: ''
  Text: 'Deprecated because Everest 856 has integrated this solution. Introduction:
    Celeste will crash and report Out of Memory Exception when the memory usage for
    it goes over about 1.4GB since Celeste is a 32-bit program. However, Microsoft
    provides a tool called editbin.exe which could modify 32-bit programs to use 4GB
    memory. I simply wrote a batch file that you could conveniently use. Instructions:
    Extract the OutOfMemoryFixTool directory to Celeste.exe directory (for example,
    C:\Steam\steamapps\common\Celeste\OutOfMemoryFixTool) and run FixOutOfMemory.bat
    32-bit system can only use up to 3GB of memory and requires further operation
    Restart the computer after running the following command with administrator privileges
    bcdedit /set increaseuserva 3072 Note: you have to re-run this tool every time

  Text: Madeline embarks on a new adventure after having met all the challenges of
    Mt. Celeste. There is not much story to this one, though you will run across some
    dialogue to give flavor and context to the events of the game. The campaign is
    currently in WIP, but planning to create at least 6 levels in the theme of the
    original locations, plus possibly B and C sides for each. Chapters I intend not
    to recreate, are Reflections and the Core. The former because I have no reason
    to throw Madeline off the mountain and the latter because I am not the biggest
    fan of the area. The difficulty of the main campaign is aimed to be high-A to
    B side level, attempting to make a little bit of a difficulty curve. Chapters
    start out fairly simple and progressively get more difficult.

  Description: ''
  Text: ^ | | A video edited using this program Introduction So uh this is a tool
    I coded to automatically edit my modded map playthrough videos. At first, I decided
    to release this on gamebanana, but in the end, after reviewing my crappy program,
    I decided to keep it private. However, someone asked me to upload it so I did
    and so it's here on gamebanana. Why this program is crap Code is sloppy. Security
    is questionable (as it rely on batch). Only works on windows. Has a lot of restrictions
    on file name and file type. Has no GUI (doesn't even have a tkinter window). I've
    only tested the python scripts on my windows 10, and I haven't used the ctrl+t
    function, not even once. Why the restrictions This wasn't intended to be released,
    and after I decided to release it I'm too lazy to change anything. A failed attempt
    to improve the program I tried making a gui for this program using tkinter. But
    it doesn't support input grabbing when the program isn't in focus (or something
    like that). So in the end the gui program was abandoned. Lastly And I hope you
    can understand what I'm saying. Also if you want to improve this crappy program
    just go do it. Instructions Download the zip file. ffmpeg and python are needed.
    1. Preparation When you're going to record your gameplay, start the flag maker
    first (so that it can receive the ctrl+s input), then open whatever recording
    software you're using. Bind ctrl+s as the start recording hotkey (this step is
    optional). Input video needs to be in mp4 format. Press ctrl+s to start both programs
    (or press ctrl+s and the start recording hotkey in quick succession to maximize
    synchronization rate). Start recording before entering the map you're going to
    record. 2. Recording Press ctrl+f to flag the current second. Press ctrl+t to
    flag the current second - 5 (5 second before the current second) Press ctrl+e
    to end the program. End the program after exiting the map. After ending the program,
    a input.txt file that store all your flags in second should appear. 3. After recording
    Move your recorded video to the same folder containing the two programs and the
    batch file. Rename it as input.mp4. Then run the batch file. It should produce
    a file named output.txt that store all the black screen starts and the black screen
    ends in second. Finally, run the automated editor file. And output.mkv should
    be generated which contains all desired segments concatted together that contain
    your input flags. You can delete other auxiliary files if you want. This program
    may fail when at some point of the game the game window is nearly pure black.
    Edit the pixel threshold in the batch file to 1 in this case (pix_th option with
    the [out0] behind it). Unless the screen is really pure black or the screen transition
    is the kind seen in, for example, Sunset Boulevard, this can prevent the issue.
    A known case of this is a certain part of Old Abyss.

    deal of polish. I changed a lot of visuals and changed how every room looks. There
    are a good deal of decals now as well as some sorely missed background tiles.
    A cheese present in the original map has been fixed. One or two rooms have been
    altered a bit to make gameplay better. In particular, the Dust Sprite (or as i
    like to call them, Goopers) path has been made so its not just random dust sprite
    garbage slammed together and has an actual pattern that can be followed. In one
    of the rooms I didn''t know the pattern at all and just hoped to get through it,
    which is horrible game design haha. I also added some custom music (all from Earthbound/Mother

    a map I''ve been working on for a while. I took my previous one (haunting temple)
    and modified it a lot. It has the following: An A-side: This is meant to be pretty
    easy, and doesn''t require anything not learnt by Mirror temple to beat. There''s
    strawberries, a tape, and a heart. If you would like to challenge yourself, see
    if you can beat it any% in sub 4 minutes. A B-side: This is a revamp of the previous
    map I made, with 12 completely new rooms, 6 modified rooms, and the rest are slightly
    modified. It''s not insane to beat, but still should have some challenges. It
    requires knowledge of some speedrun tech (ext hypers, wallkicks, theo catching,
    neutrals will help) A C-side: This follows the classic three room formula, and
    the last room is definitely a challenge. If you have trouble unlocking this, you
    will probably need the heart in the first chapter. Either find it, or use debug/cheat
    mode to skip past it. Hope it is a lot of fun. Let me know if you have any feedback,
    from crashes and cheeses, to rooms being janky. I''ll be keen to hear about them.
    Thanks also to all the people who helped test!'

  Description: ''
  Text: I made this room for a Celeste collab, then realized there isn't supposed
    to be a cassette block room in it. Oops! This would not have linked to a b-side,
    it was just me playing around with cassette blocks until I got a decent challenge.
    It's about as hard as the later rooms in any default b-side. This map doesn't
    take itself very seriously outside of the actual cassette block room, and it likely
    won't ever be expanded upon.

  Text: A slow-motion high-speed map consisting of 5 levels with very precise gameplay,
    aided by the low-gravity effect applied in the end of Core's A and B sides. The
    main levels aren't really comparable to anything in the main game, a fair bit
    harder than the C sides but much more technically advanced. Knowledge of spike
    clipping and wallbounce momentum conservation is required, as well as everything
    you're required to use in the main game.
